'Fantasia,' in a way I feel like I should have a medal for bravery or something. We all make our mistakes, I know, but it was an honest mistake. But this, this is too much.  I'm well aware of the high ideals that this award symbolizes, and I sort of feel like I should rededicate myself to those ideals. I've been through a very trying year, the toughest year. I hope there's never another one like it. And coming after that year, I sort of feel, I'd like to feel that it's more than an award for past conscientious efforts, honest mistakes. I like to feel that it's sort of a vote of a confidence for the future. And I want to thank the members of the Academy, my friends, everybody. Thank you."

That is really all there is to say; but, as this is after all the opportunity of a lifetime, I hope you won't mind if I try to expand that word just, just a little. This is, this is going to be a great evening to remember. We've had some very exciting messages and some very exciting speeches. It should make us all very proud to belong to this great and fascinating industry. Praise from our government and our armed forces and from abroad from our allies for work we have done should make us determined to carry on. We have somehow brought very wide horizons into this room tonight. Anything that I have to say now, which is practically unprepared... [camera cuts]  As for the nominations, I've always felt that to be nominated simply means that you've had the great good luck to be entrusted with one of the best assignments of the current year, and that's a cause for rejoicing in itself. And there isn't a single good craftsman in this industry who if given such an opportunity can't be counted on to measure up to it. Why do we all long to win the award? It's no question of superiority because we're comparing different excellences and they're varied in their nature and they can't be fairly compared. There's no rivalry in this room tonight. There's no competition. As the Dodo said to Alice in Wonderland: 'Everybody has won and everybody shall have a prize.' The nominations are really the prizes. The award...I, I can hardly believe that it's really for me tonight. It's always seemed to me something very personal, a gesture from the men and women of this industry who choose to show not only recognition of, of work... [camera cuts]  Ladies and gentlemen, I came to this country as a stranger five years ago. I've been very happy and very proud to be a member of this community and of this industry all that time. And from everybody I met or worked with truly I have received such ready kindness that for quite a long while I couldn't believe that it was true, but tonight you have made me feel that you have really set the door of your friendship wide open and that welcome is officially on the mat, and that is why I'm so happy. [camera cuts]  ...very humbly, very gratefully I say thank you and I step across your threshold. There...

[camera cuts]  I feel that this statuette should go to that grand artistic person who was the producer of that picture. He's not here tonight because it was necessary, most necessary, to have him sent away for a rest. The director received the award for the direction; and properly so. I think Mervyn should've had one, too, for 'Random Harvest.' [camera cuts]  ...for the screenplay, the cameraman for the photography. And if Sidney was here, he'd say, 'Well, with such writers and an author who had a grand set of characters and a grand idea, with such direction, and with such stars and supporting cast, anybody could've done it.'

But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now. When I think of the writer who created 'Jody Norris,' and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her. And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her.

However, tonight I, uh, dressed for the stage just in case.  But in all honesty, I suppose I couldn't expect to be more elated than I was when I heard I was nominated, because I had seen and I knew the beautiful jobs done by the other four nominees: Rosalind's vitality and her great technical skill in bringing that classic character to life; Joan's expert craftsmanship in 'Possessed'; and the magic and delicacy that Dorothy McGuire brings to any role, and particularly in this one; and the superb artistry of Susan Hayward who succeeded in turning a very difficult characterization into an authentic character and a personal triumph. Yes, yes, I think my great thrill was when 'Katie' was voted into that class. Course, we all know there wouldn't have been any 'Katie' if it hadn't have been beautifully written and directed and photographed and... and magnificently produced by Mr. Dore Schary. For my part, I am thankful to have been in a picture that made so many people think fondly and possessively of their country, and of our industry that can give them those thoughts.  And as for you [looking at Oscar], at long last! Good night and God bless you."

And wonderfully, George Seaton has his revenge by bringing him to life. About a year and a half ago he suddenly turned up in Culver City and told me his name was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That was the day Metro agreed to loan me to Fox to make the picture. And now I think it's time Santa Claus added a word to his name. I think he ought to call himself Santa Claus, Incorporated. Santa Claus, Inc. Inc.! For then he would embrace all you wonderful, kind people who have done me the honor of making me stand here tonight.

I saw the movies when they were in their swaddling clothes. We began at the very beginning. I showed my first Vitagraph picture fifty-two years ago in March of 1896. Then Vitagraph made its first comedy in 1897, fifty-one years ago. It was a little picture with a cast of three. The total cost of production was $3.50 minus the cost of film, which at that time was seven and 7/8 cents per foot. The next year, in 1898, we produced our first feature picture. It was a reproduction of the Battle of Santiago Bay, or the destruction of Admiral Cervera's Spanish fleet. The total cost of production was $1.98. This was inexpensive because we made the picture from cutouts of photographs which we tacked to little bits of wood and put in water with a piece of white cardboard in the rear for the sky. The press was very good. The press said that the picture was even better than the battle itself so it must have been good. And so I feel very proud and very happy to have seen that little child in swaddling clothes grow up to be such a big and beautiful lady. And I want to thank everyone who has had a part in so doing and I want to thank the Academy for remembering the forgotten man."

All of you who are connected with this picture – Stanley, Mike, Carl, Frank Planer, George, Mala, Bill Prince, Morris Carnovsky, all of you – you know as well as I do that it's your Oscar as much as it is mine. Also, to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy who voted for me, you must know that this means more to me than just the honor accorded to an actor, and from the bottom of my heart I thank you for what I consider a vote of confidence and an act of faith.

And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off of horses into pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport, spouted all this good sportsmanship, I'm gonna go back and find my business manager, and agent, and producer, and three-name writer, and find out why I didn't get 'High Noon' instead of Cooper.

Kahane bestowed two honorary awards; one to Lee DeForest.... and the other to Buster Keaton, 'for having made at least half a dozen films which will play as long as films are shown,' and 'for sometimes having raised laughter to the status of high poetry.''  [Source: 'Keaton receives special film prize' by Murray Schumach. The New York Times, April 6, 1960, p. 46] 'A loud outburst of applause and cheers ensued. In the midst of the ovation, Mr. Keaton, sad-faced as in his movies, walked slowly across the emptied dance floor toward Mr. Hope. As he neared him, a large section of the audience rose in tribute to one of the masters of deadpan comedy. Mr. Keaton gave no indication that he was aware of the reception. He accepted the Oscar with a brief 'thank you' and, still without a shadow of a smile, trudged slowly back to his table in the ballroom of the Beverly-Hilton Hotel.'  [Source: 'Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase' by Marion Meade, p. 288] 'As Keaton trudged up to receive his Oscar from master of ceremonies Bob Hope, many in the audience rose to their feet. Keaton, who had no idea he was to get an award, was 'all choked up,' Eleanor [Keaton] recalled. He accepted the statue, murmured 'Thank you,' and walked slowly back to his seat, without a shadow of a smile.'"

They made the world laugh [for] 24 years. Twenty-four years. And they made us laugh because in them we kind of saw ourselves – ridiculous, frustrated, up to our necks in trouble, but nevertheless ourselves. Oliver Hardy delicately tipped his derby hat with his pudgy little fingers and left us a little while back. But the thin, sad-faced one, the one from whose fertile mind sprang many of the universally humorous notions that have been borrowed so freely by the comedians who have followed, he's still with us. Unhappily, he isn't well enough to be here with us this evening, but I'm very proud indeed to accept for him from the Board of Governors this award for 'creative pioneering in the field of comedy,' presented to one of the really great men of our chosen profession, Mr. Stan Laurel."

Not only to comment, maybe, but to maybe have a shot at reshaping that world. It's a long way from that room to this hall and I couldn't accept this without, without mentioning a couple of allies I'd picked up on the way. One, of course, is my brilliant mentor, Stanley Kramer; a man of courage, talent, and a man of his word.

I've also got a couple of metaphorical Oscars of my own which I want to bestow. One to Bill Graf, our executive producer, who brought Freddy and myself together and suggested that we have a go at it. And the other one to Johnny Box, who on a pretty small budget created the mock-ups of various palaces and castles, inside and out, which were so good that I, I think in common with a lot of other people, when I first saw them on the rushes, thought they were the real thing.

[Banters with presenter Frank Sinatra.]  I'm very grateful to the Academy's Board of Directors for this happy tribute and to Frank for coming here especially to give it to me. And well, to all the fellows who worked so hard in finding those and assembling those film clips.  You know, I may never look at this without remembering the quiet patience of the directors who were so kind to me, who were kind enough to put up with me more than once, some of them even three or four times. There was Howard Hawks, Hitchcock, the late Leo McCarey, George Stevens, George Cukor and Stanley Donen. And all the writers. There was Philip Barry, Dore Schary, Bob Sherwood, Ben Hecht, dear Clifford Odets, Sidney Sheldon, and more recently Stanley Shapiro and Peter Stone. Well, I trust they, and all the other directors, writers and producers and leading women, have all forgiven me what I didn't know.  I realize it's conventional and usual to praise one's fellow workers on these occasions, but why not?! Ours is a collaborative medium, we all need each other. That's how we exist. And what better opportunity is there to publicly express one's appreciation and admiration and affection for all those who contribute so much to each of our welfare. You know, I've never been a joiner or a member of any particular social set, but I've been privileged to be a part of Hollywood's most glorious era. And yet tonight, thinking of all the empty screens that are waiting to be filled with marvelous images and idealogies, points of view, whatever, and considering all the students who are studying film techniques in the universities throughout the world and the astonishing young talents that are coming up in our midst, I think there's an even more glorious era right around the corner.  So before I leave you, I want to thank you very much for signifying your approval with this. I shall cherish it until I die, because probably no greater honor can come to any man than the respect of his colleagues. Thank you. So long."

Over the years I've been part of the awards wearing many different hats – performer, emcee, presenter, recipient – but this is the top of the moment of my little walk-on in life, you might say. And I've been doing a little more thinking and contemplating these days than I did twenty-five years ago. That's because I'm what is known in the vernacular as a retired man now. You might have read about that in your neighborhood throw-aways.  One of the things I've been thinking about is why you have to get famous to get an award for helping other people. I'm not being facetious about it; I've just been thinking about it. It's true, actually. If your name is John Doe and you work night and day doing things for your helpless neighbors, what you get for your effort is tired. So Mr. and Mrs. Doe and all of you who give of yourselves to those who carry too big a burden to make it on their own, I want you to reach out and take your share of this Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Because if I have earned it so, too, have you. In fact, your way of earning it was harder than my way. Show business has made it easier for me to spread a dab of sunshine here and there. I mean, in show business they pay quite well. And being the quiet, conservative man that I am, I have invested a chunk at 3 percent and put the dividends to work in that noblest of all causes: charity toward your fellow man. It's the only investment in the world that pays 100 percent dividend. Anyway, it's put a great big bundle in here [touches his heart] for me, and I'd like to thank my dear brothers and sisters of the Academy for this joyous moment. Thank you."

Looking backward over some thirty years in the movies is something that I like to do as seldom as possible, but I can't forget that I didn't spend those years alone. Every filmmaker knows how much was done for him and by how many. If I could call just half of all those who deserve it to stand beside me now in front of this camera, just to get 'em in one shot we'd need Cinerama. It'd be quite a crowd scene.  As for the public, I hope that they will understand why this is the more precious just because it does not come to me from them, much less from the critics, but from movie people themselves, the ones who love movies most. We need the public; the public doesn't need us. That's the truth of it. We don't really fill a pressing popular need; we try to create it. And if we didn't love movies as much as we do, if we weren't a little crazy on the subject, there wouldn't be any movies at all. I treasure this award as an expression of this happy lunacy, and may I accept it, please, not so much for what I may have done as for what I hope to do. God willing I'm going to make some movies that deserve it. Meanwhile, this encouragement is very welcome. With all my heart, I thank you for it."

He isn't here because he feels that a long trip at this moment would do great harm to his concentration on work and he believes that he shows his respect and gratefulness to the honor bestowed to him by the Board and members of the Academy by staying home finishing his script.

And then after about forty minutes I thought of something to say but I started to get very nervous that I would never get to come up here to say it. And I've forgotten it, whatever it was.  Firstly, I'd like to thank Peter Bart who was responsible for getting me this job in the first place, which sort of rescued me from my wonderful, romantic financial adventure in San Francisco, which still lives. And then, giving credit where it's due, I'd like to thank Bob Towne who wrote the very beautiful scene between Marlon and Al Pacino in the garden; that was Bob Towne's scene. And lastly, I would like to congratulate Bob Fosse. And also say that the best award a director could get would be to have three of his best friends and dear associates and actors – Jimmy Caan, Al Pacino and Bobby Duvall – all get nominated in the same category. Thank you very much."

I was listening to his words back there, Frank, and I thought for a minute, someone out there'll think I was kind of special – far from it. You know the people of this nation have a golden tradition of taking care of each other. And across America right now there are men and women, countless numbers of them, young and old, who are giving of themselves to hospitals, to orphanages, to drug clinics, to youth, and even possibly watching a little child take her first steps after being crippled as I have watched. So the only unique thing about me tonight is that I am here with this, knowing that it belongs to so many others. I would also like to tell you that I have been the victim of this kindness, and I want to thank each and every one of them and all the letters that were sent to me over the years for all they did for me while I was not quite well.

If I took the time to thank all of the people, very honestly, that are responsible for this award we'd be here much too long. But naturally to Marty Ransohoff, and Filmways and Paramount. I am deeply indebted for them letting us even make the film, because nobody wanted to let us make it. To Steve Shagan and John Avildsen. It would take much too much and much too long and I'll have to do it personally later. And to a cast and a crew of people, I've never in my life been connected with anything that meant more to me and worked with so many wonderful professional people that cared and loved something so much. And they made it one of the great, great moments of my life, the making of that film, and that's equal to this honor, just the privilege of working with them, truthfully. And I thank them all and I love them and respect them.  I just want to say one more thing. In recent years especially there has been a great deal of criticism about this award. And probably a great deal of that criticism is very justified. I would just like to say that whether it's justified or not, I think it is one hell of an honor and I am thrilled.

GENE KELLY [translating]: Well, around 1916 and 1917 in France, everyone who counted, or I should better say, all the really important artists in France, like Picasso and Proust and Diaghilev and Stravinsky, became crazy about the American cinema. They fell in love with it to such an extent that they uplifted the creators and the makers of French films, from Delluc, Renoir and Abel Gance way back then, up to nowadays Truffaut and Godard.

To have Katharine Hepburn and the award at the same time is an emotional package that I cannot cope with. To all but her intimate friends, Kate's performances on the screen have revealed the patrician, the sophisticate and the iconoclast, but tonight she has revealed to you another side of her character. As you can see she is a considerate, sympathetic, unselfish and altogether beautiful human being. And so to Katharine Hepburn and all the great performing artists, men and women, upon whom I have depended; to those remarkably talented writers, directors, craftsmen; and to Louis B. Mayer, whose unstinting support and encouragement made it possible for me to put the whole thing together; to all these wonderful and unique people: my gratitude, my admiration and my respect.  Now in thanking the Board of Governors of the Academy for this ultimate compliment, I would like them to know that this award bears an added significance for me. It was at the side of this extraordinarily gifted man, Irving Thalberg, that I learned my craft. And if it were not for my long and close association with him, I would not be standing here tonight.

Therefore I am... It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year. I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all.

And it's, I'm really happy I did. I just want to thank Gordie Willis who was the photographer, who did a beautiful job.

It says: 'Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam.

HOWARD HAWKS: And when he became sick and came to the desert to die, I used to go over and see him. We'd talk and laugh. Then we got to telling each other the things that we'd stolen from each other. And we often tried to remember all of the things I tried to, that I took from Ford and he did from me. One day he was laughing and he said, 'There's something I took from you that beats the whole thing.' He said, 'I made a picture that wasn't so good, and you made 'Sergeant York.'' And he said, 'I got the award.' And he stopped in the middle of laughing and he changed – just as Duke knows and other people, he changed quickly. And he said, 'Well, you're gonna get an award.' And I said, 'I don't think so.' He said, 'Goddamn it! You're gonna get an award.' So I would like to thank the Academy for making that prediction of his come true. Thanks very much."

What is gratifying right now is to know that you share our pride and our passion with us. Thank yous must go to a magnificent cast and crew. To Kirk Douglas, who lived with it for fourteen years. The people at Fantasy in Berkeley. To the people at United Artists, all over the world. And to Arthur Krim, Eric Pleskow and Mike Medavoy, who became believers the first moment of contact with 'Cuckoo's Nest.' And my love to Dorian, Josh, Athena and Jonny. And dreams do come true.  MICHAEL DOUGLAS: I think 'It Happened One Night,' picture 1937, the last time a film won picture, director, actor, actress. I'd just like to really thank the Academy for all your support. And to our really incredible cast and crew, who I think we all learned something about working ensemble. And as Saul said, United Artists. The state of Oregon.

Well, it certainly is thrilling for me and it's nice to get the Irving Thalberg Award handed to me from another director, and a good one, too. I was a very dear, dear friend of Irving Thalberg's and it was a shame that a man like Irving Thalberg had to pass away at thirty-seven years old. He was a genius. He had great heart, great feeling, great imagination. After a preview that you'd go to, Irving would sit up with you upstairs at Metro and he'd say, 'I know what's good about the picture, tell me what's wrong about the picture.' And Irving never made a criticism about a movie unless he could improve it. That's the kind of a man he was. And this means so much to me that I can't tell you. He was quite a guy. I loved him. He was very close to me. I wish we had more Irving Thalbergs around today, but they're around and they'll come out, believe me.  I want to thank the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for giving me this beautiful award, voting it for me, believing in me, because they've done so much for the world. And tonight I think they've done more for the world than ever by showing what Hollywood does and running all of these beautiful acts and beautiful scenes on Telstar, of which I am a stockholder. We were going to run some films tonight but they're a little late and I'm a little late and I'm a little nervous. And I want to thank you all and I love you all. And this means so much to me. Thank you."

Ironically, all three films have in common that they were made against well-meant advice and that they were made without any commercial concessions or considerations whatsoever. I believe it is a tribute to the Academy that it has chosen 'Black and White in Color,' a film entirely made in remote West Africa, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, a man who had never directed a feature film before, and played by a cast of excellent actors, albeit unknown. I would like to say that it is this kind of recognition and of encouragement which keeps our industry fresh and alive and ever creative. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

I had nothing to lose so I played my hunches. A standard complaint of producers over the years has been that the studio ruined the picture or got me to change it, or the ads were lousy or the distributor didn't understand the film. In my case this wasn't so. The pictures that went out with my name -- good, bad or indifferent -- were produced by me. And when I knew what I wanted, and when I wanted it badly enough, I got it on the screen. My thanks to the Academy for not being indifferent and for forgetting the bad and remembering the good."

And I salute that record, and I salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against that period when Nixon and McCarthy launched a worldwide witch hunt against those who tried to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believed in. I salute you, and I thank you, and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against anti-Semitism and fascism. Thank you."

A lot of people helped us: Dean Speroni, the Dean's Council, the UCLA Art Council, Ray Wagner, so many others I can't mention them all tonight.

But I want to say just a couple of things about how a filmmaker like Woody evolves. About seven years ago, David Picker brought us into United Artists with the simple words: Woody, do your thing. And through the years we have gotten nothing but support, encouragement, help and love from Eric Pleskow, Arthur Krim, Gabe Sumner and Danny Rissner. They've allowed Woody to mature into a fine filmmaker. This is truly an exciting night for all of us. I guess we all fantasize about something like this happening and now it's a reality. I'm very pleased. And thank you.  JACK ROLLINS: I understand that Bob Hope had made a statement earlier today that Woody's nomination was gonna have some importance in bringing comedy forward in the Academy affairs.

And you've all been very kind. And I must confess, the only problem is I've been out here a week and I still have guilt when I make a right turn on a red light; maybe this will help."

Mr. President and governors of the Academy, committee members, fellows, my very noble and approved good masters, my colleagues, my friends, my fellow students: In the great wealth, the great firmament of your nation's generosities, this particular choice may perhaps be found by future generations as a trifle eccentric. But the mere fact of it, the prodigal, pure, human kindness of it must be seen as a beautiful star in that firmament which shines upon me at this moment, dazzling me a little, but filling me with warmth and the extraordinary elation, the euphoria that happens to so many of us at the first breath of the majestic glow of a new tomorrow. From the top of this moment, in the solace, in the kindly emotion that is charging my soul and my heart at this moment, I thank you for this great gift which lends me such a very splendid part in this, your glorious occasion.

I don't think there's an actor here or watching this proceeding tonight who doesn't acknowledge a great debt to the continuing legacy of Laurence Olivier. And his presence here tonight has put a great perspective and just, on the proceedings for me, and a warm and generous and dignified one, and I'm not quite able to recover from it, I tell you.  The performances this year in this category are remarkable, really. I am a great fan of the other members of the nominated body. And I know that we are all extremely aware of the extraordinary performances that we have been selected to represent. For my own part I have, as we all do, many people to thank for a performance which stands among this group of performances. I would like to thank everyone, but I select to thank a few who represent the many.  I would like to thank Bruce Dern, my friend, for his encouragement and his wonderful performance, and his friendship. I would like to thank Jerry Hellman, who produced also 'Midnight Cowboy;' is an extraordinary man, a great producer, a tenacious fighter, who keeps us all healthy and has great taste. I would like to thank Hal Ashby, a remarkable, a remarkable person who was so helpful in getting me to myself and encouraging my performance. And finally I would like to thank Jane, whose great dignity as a human being – it's a good thing she's not here to see this – is very moving to me. And finally, I'm carrying with me all the men who gave me so much of their experience to deal with, who have contributed so much: the people in chairs, and the veterans, and the civilians, and the walkers, who are so strongly represented in what I'd call my work.

They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them. [End sign language.]  I'm so proud and grateful. It's been almost eight years. This film, 'Coming Home,' was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor. And some of them were veterans. I thank, I thank all of them. One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of 'Coming Home.'  I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...? Heavy. The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project. In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing. And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us. And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much. And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch. And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors. And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.  And finally I want to thank my children, Troy and Vanessa, for being understanding and forgiving me my absences.

I'm thinking of them tonight. Thank you.

Bobby Muller and his fine wife, Bill Hager, T. Hager, Ron Kovic, Roger Steffens and his Mary, Tim Page, and so many others that I can't list; I hope that they will forgive me. Some of the people, who would prefer not to be named I believe, who worked in the veterans facilities here in the Bronx and who shared their experiences with us. To all of the men who fought in Vietnam: those who lost their lives, those who lost their innocence, and those who, working with defoliants, still don't know whether they've lost their lives. Thank you.  ROBERT C. JONES: I would like to thank our extremely talented director, Hal Ashby; producer, Jerome Hellman; and a really, really amazing cast. Thank you."

They give generously of their time, talents and efforts, and financial resources to many worthwhile causes, be they philanthropic, civic or educational, that will help improve the quality of life.

That this seems self-evident now is importantly due to the pioneering work of our Department of Film. Film continues to be one of the liveliest of the arts and we're committed to the films of today as we are to the preserving of the films of the past.  This award properly belongs to the members of the department throughout its history. From Iris Barry, its founder and first curator, through to the present: Eileen Bowser, Adrienne Mancia, Mary Lea Bandy and her colleagues. They have all had in common dedication, knowledge, and above all, sheer love of motion pictures. Others have helped, and I cannot imagine a better example than Blanchette Rockefeller.  MRS. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER III: I would like to express special gratitude to the wide community of people within the film world and outside it who have given support and encouragement in more ways than I can mention. This marvelous and deeply appreciated tribute from the Academy is a tribute to all of them as well. Thank you most warmly."

I'm up here with mixed feelings. I've been critical of the Academy, and for reason. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be able to work. I am greatly honored for being chosen by the producer, Stanley Jaffe, and the director, Bob Benton, and to have worked in a family with them, and with Meryl and with Justin, who if he loses again we'll have to give him a lifetime achievement award. And to Jane Alexander and to Jerry Greenberg and to Néstor and to the crew on the film who was part of that family. And to the crew and to the directors like Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols and John Schlesinger that I've worked with before. We are laughed at when we are up here, sometimes, for thanking. But when you work on a film you discover that there are people who are giving that artistic part of themself that goes beyond a paycheck, and they are never up here. And many of them are not members of the Academy, and we never hear of them. But this Oscar is a symbol, I think, and it is given for appreciation from those people whom we never see. They are part of our life.  I refuse to believe that I beat Jack Lemmon, that I beat Al Pacino, that I beat Peter Sellers. I refuse to believe that Robert Duvall lost. We are a part of an artistic family. There are sixty thousand actors in this Academy – pardon me – in the Screen Actors Guild, and probably a hundred thousand in Equity. And most actors don't work, and a few of us are so lucky to have a chance to work with writing and to work with directing. Because when you're a broke actor you can't write; you can't paint; you have to practice accents while you're driving a taxi cab. And to that artistic family that strives for excellence, none of you have ever lost and I am proud to share this with you. And I thank you."

It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. And it truly was a gift, every single word. It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me. It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.  And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt. Marty Ritt is 'Norma Rae.' He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less. And I thank him for that. He's taught me a lot. And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.  And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me.

'Best Boy' took three-and-a-half years to make but it was very much a labor of love. And it tells the story of my fifty-two-year-old cousin Philly, who's mentally retarded, and his parents who are near eighty and about how he finally comes to separate from them as their lives end and his life has to go on. The film has been seen mainly on the East Coast, and with documentaries it's not always easy to get people to come and see the film. And if this award will help more people to come and see it then it will really be doing its job.  I want to thank the Association for the Help of Retarded Children in New York City for their support of the film and for the wonderful work they did with Philly. I want to thank the entire crew, but in particular Tom McDonough, director of photography, who gave his sensitivity and intelligence and understanding and made the film much more than it would have otherwise been. I want to thank my cousins Frances and Norman, my aunt and uncle who are no longer alive, my aunt Pearl, my uncle Max. And most of all I want to thank my cousin Philly who gave me the opportunity to do the most important thing I've ever done in my life and who has continually reminded me how very delicate and beautiful any single human life can be.

So, this what it's meant. It's a little boy actor, he has in common with this one [referring to the statuette] of being small but only in size.  You know, it's the first award ever given to a film of my country. There's been lots of reasons for that we know, but I take it as a tribute also for my fellow directors over there and for all those whose tradition we want to pick up and follow and who worked and lived here. I mean Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, Murnau, Pabst. You know them all; you welcomed them. Thank you."

Blessed because Bob Benton was free, and he wrote and directed it. And I was lucky enough to be able to get, along with Bob and the words he wrote, Dustin and Meryl and Jane and Justin. And it's a film that's made with love, and it's made about love. And it was cut by Jerry, and Néstor shot it. And it would not have been made had it not been for the encouragement of Columbia Pictures, Frank Price, John Veitch, and most especially two dear friends of mine, Dan Melnick and Sherry Lansing.  It is about love, and from four people in my life I have learned more about that than ever. I speak of Ingeborg Sørensen and her son Adam, and I speak about my children, Bobby and Betsy.

Sam Cohn, without him I would not be here at all. Peter Yates, without him the screenplay would not have been written; it would not have been written as well and it certainly wouldn't have looked like it did. Let's see, there's Gareth Wigan – oh my God, I'm getting to the past and present of studios like Benton did – Alan Ladd, the present Fox people.  The last thing I want to say is that long before I actually saw America, my first glimpses of it were in a movie house in Yugoslavia. It was a western, 'Stagecoach,' and it seemed like a wonderful, endless frontier of a country where these good and evil characters fought it out for the soul of America. And after all these years of being here I am just so grateful to be given an opportunity to send back a film and to tell 'em that I find it very much like the place I had seen originally: The good and the bad still fight it out; the good still tend to win in the end.

It's five weeks ago that I had a telegram from the Academy telling me they were doing me this great honor, so I've had the time to recover from the shock. But I don't think I will ever have time to get over my amazement and my delight. There isn't time for me to thank everyone – directors, writers, fellow actors – who've made my life such a happy one, including those wonderful Hollywood stars who were my heroes when I was a youth.  You know, when I was a drama student forty-seven years ago, I think, there used to be a formidable lady who came to take classes of what she called 'film technique.' And she arrived with a large wooden frame about four-foot square which she placed in front of our faces saying it was a close-up. And then she barked at us: Show fear, anger, joy, despair. And I quickly learned how to get maybe a laugh or two out of my fellow students. And then it dawned on me that, if I was seriously going to have a career in movies, the wisest thing was to do absolutely nothing at all. And that is more or less what I've done since then. I feel very fraudulent taking this, but not letting any expression pass over my face, I thank you most sincerely for the warmth of your reception and your great kindness; and to Dustin, again. And I'm grabbing this while the going's good. Thank you. Good night."

Unfortunately, I've known about this for weeks, and with intense preparation I'm still speechless except for these notes. I'm deeply moved and appreciative that the Board of Governors and the Academy have honored me. I am privileged to have worked, and with a past, for and with all of the greats that have been recipients of the award: David Selznick, Goldwyn, Zanuck. The Thalberg Award is given for a body of work, but in my case it's been given for the privilege of working with a body of talent. Starting with, years ago, with writers like Ben Hecht through Isobel Lennart to Neil Simon, and with stops along the way for friends and mentors like Charlie Feldman, like John Huston, and so many directors, actors and great other talents.

Well, I just didn't think I was gonna see this. But I'm no less grateful. And I would like to express my debt for the directors that I worked with in the past, for what I've learned from them, consciously or unconsciously. And I would also like to say that, it may not be too fashionable but the fact is that I really do appreciate the support of Paramount Pictures, Charlie Bluhdorn, Barry Diller. They let us make the film the way we wanted to and I'm very grateful for that.  There are a lot of people that I can thank, and I don't want to go on too long, but I couldn't go too much further without expressing what for me is the greatest gratitude. And that keys around the word trust. I really am grateful for the trust that I received from a terrific cast: Mary, Donald, Tim, Judd, Liz. I love them, and I appreciate their love, too. So thank you all."

There are a few people I must thank, and too few in the time we have. First and foremost, the executive producer Walter Scheuer, who had the vision not only to initiate the project but the courage to finance it, and that took a lot of courage because it was a long and complex project. Allan Miller, Tom Haneke and the editorial crew who so beautifully completed the film. The location crew who, challenged by what they saw in China, worked with me unceasingly from dawn until midnight throughout the length of the production. But most of all I would like to thank the Chinese people who greeted us so warmly and allowed us to film what for them was unusual in such an open and frank way.  In the face of so much senseless violence in the world I hope that this vote is a vote not only for the film, but for a process: the fellowship—communication through the fellowship of music which imparts harmony into the human heart rather than violence. And I hope that this and I believe it can contribute in some way towards our living together peacefully both as neighbors and as nations. Thank you."

But Shirlee wanted to be with him tonight, as is her way, and so I'm here.  And first and foremost I want to thank on behalf of my father the members of the Academy who voted to give him this award. I know that he's watching right now and I know that he's very, very honored and very happy and surprised. And I'll bet when he heard it just now, I bet he said, 'Hey, ain't I lucky?' As though luck had anything to do with it. I know also that he has tremendous respect for the other actors that were nominated and has always felt a little strange about these things, these competitions, because it's like comparing apples and oranges, and he feels very proud to have been among such a wonderful group.  And I know that he feels that he would never have won this if it hadn't been for Katharine Hepburn. And if 'On Golden Pond' is one of the highlights of his life, one of the main reasons is because of her, having the chance to work with her and to become her friend. And I know that one of the other reasons that he feels the film was so special is because of the quality of the crew. Every one of them, many of whose talents have been recognized tonight in the nominations. And the wonderful cast: Dougie McKeon, Dabney Coleman, Bill Lanteau, me—he's a proud father. The man who pulled us all together, our producer Bruce Gilbert. He is, my father is so happy, he feels so fortunate to have been able to play the role of 'Norman Thayer,' a character that he loves a lot and understands very well. And for this he'd like to thank the sensitive man who wrote the words, who's already been honored tonight, Ernest Thompson. And for the tremendous talent and guidance of our director Mark Rydell, he's very, very grateful. We all became like a family during the filming and we sort of stayed together since. People call him up and stay in touch and come to visit him, and so it's like we've stayed a family, and it's made my father very, very happy. And he wants to thank Marble Arch and Universal for their support of the movie 'On Golden Pond.'  He also feels very lucky to have been able to spend a summer in such a beautiful part of our country, northern New Hampshire, and he wants to thank all the people there who were so friendly and welcoming to us. And he was very happy, and so was I and are we, to have had our two families together, the Haydens and the Fondas, on the beautiful shores of that lake so that we could get to know each other even more. He wishes my brother Peter were here tonight, but Peter is somewhere in the jungles of the Philippines in front of a camera right now, like a good Fonda. And I know that lastly, but really first, he is thanking Shirlee Fonda who has been his loving support for seventeen years, who he calls his Rock of Gibralter. I think she's his 'Ethel Thayer.' Dad, me and all the grandchildren are coming over with it right away. Thank you."

Mr. Nicholson, I know that you're enjoying my being up here almost as much as I am in being here.  I know I do one thing well, I get good people: Elaine May, Peter Feibleman, Jeremy Pikser, Robert Towne, Simon Relph, Zelda Barron, Richie Cirincione, Steve Sondheim, Dave Grusin, David MacLeod, so many, many more among whom are the people that you've nominated here tonight and happily saved me from having to remember to name fourteen more names. I do want to name Mr. Barry Diller who runs Paramount, Mr. Dick Zimbert who's been very kind to me, Mr. Frank Mancuso, and Mr. Charles Bluhdorn who runs Gulf + Western and God knows what else. And I want to say to you gentlemen that no matter how much we might have liked to have strangled each other from time to time, I think that your decision, taken in the great capitalistic tower of Gulf + Western, to finance a three-and-a-half hour romance which attempts to reveal for the first time just something of the beginnings of American socialism and American communism, reflects credit not only upon you, I think it reflects credit upon Hollywood and the movie business wherever that is. And I think that it reflects more particular credit on the freedom of expression that we have in our American society and the lack of censorship that we have from the government or the people who put up the money. Thanks."

In particular I'd like to acknowledge two men who were my first producing partners. The first was Irving Allen, and together we enjoyed making the films that Roger Moore mentioned. The second was my partner, former partner, Harry Saltzman, who also envisaged the possible success of 'James Bond.' And together we received the go ahead from a very dear friend of mine, Arthur Krim.

Tonight for my being here, and the responsibility really belongs to somebody that I'd love to put my arms around, like Judy Garland, and Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Spencer Tracy, Wallace Beery. Memories, I have a lot of memories, as we all do.  When I was nineteen years old I was the number one star of the world, for two years. When I was forty, nobody wanted me. I couldn't get a job.

Last year God smiled upon me and I was given the Emmy for 'Bill,' and I won the Peabody Award and the Golden Globe, and tonight you honor me beyond anything that a man should be given. You honor me with the greatest and the highest tribute we can receive in our business.  My family all love you and they're all tingling inside because of this moment for me. I'd love to even kiss Louis B. Mayer. But it's, it's wonderful. The woman who put it all together was Ruth Webb, my agent, who picked up the pieces and put 'em back together. Mickey, Jr., Timmy, Teddy, Kelly, Kerry, Kyle, Kimmy Sue, Jimmy, Jonell, Chris and Mark, and my grandchildren, my grandchildren Shannon and Nika*. They're home tonight looking and saying, 'That's Granddaddy up there, and he's got the Oscar.' But the one that's responsible, outside of God, is my wife Jan, who kept saying to me for the last seven years, 'I know you can do it, Mick. Get up off the canvas. You can do it.' I want to thank you, one and all, for remembering me. Thank you for this glorious moment. God bless and good night."

And to his widow Dorothy, and Shanta and Rajni, I send my love and my very grateful thanks for the fact that their father gave me the idea of making this film.  Members of the Academy, you have honored, you have seen fit to honor a number of people who have been connected with this film -- Jack and Ben and Billy, and many others. And particularly without Jack and Ben there would have been no movie. But I'm sure that they would agree that the person whom you really honor, as Ben suggested, was Mahatma Gandhi himself. He was an inspiration to millions and millions of people, and the extraordinary thing always seems to me, that he is currently still an inspiration. Your great folk hero Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Lech Walesa, that noble Polish patriot, came out of prison the other day and said that what he had been attempting to do in the past was not going to work. The only way in which we could find human dignity and peace was through the philosophies and teachings of Gandhi.  Gandhi simply asked that we should examine the criteria by which we adjudge the manner of solving our problems. That surely in the 20th century we human beings searching for our human dignity could find other ways of ultimately solving our problems than blowing the other man's head off. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. He believed that if we would but agree, simplistic though it be, that we would not resort to violence in the ultimate. Then the route that we would take in solving our problems would be a quite different one to the one that we accept now in the acceptance of ultimate confrontation. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. I believe he had something to say to all of us everywhere in the world.  And dear colleagues, in all truth -- because the films that were nominated with me all wished for the same thing, all their makers wanted to say the same thing -- and in all truth it is not me or even Ben or Jack or Billy that you truly honor. You honor Mahatma Gandhi and his plea to all of us to live in peace."

One to Dickie, Sir Richard, for having the faith and courage to trust me with his dream, put up with me once it became mine too, and fulfilling both our dreams with such brilliance and honesty. And to Ben, for a performance that went beyond dreams. For me it's still emotional to watch Ben although I've seen it like fifty or sixty times. I think it's so moving and so profound that it does an honor to our whole industry and justice even to the man that inspired the whole film.  And then I would like to thank Gandhi himself. When I came to this material I despaired for it as drama and I didn't think it had much relevance in a world as cruel and as harsh as ours. But as I came to know the man I found that he knew everything we all know about our cruelty, our selfishness, our greed, our fears. But he also had a faith in the kind of stubborn resolution that we all have to be a little humane, to be a little understanding, to be a little, even, brotherly. And he lived his life in a way that showed that if we called upon that in ourselves and in our enemies, that there was hope for each of us and maybe for this planet. He gave me that. I tried in writing the screenplay to give it back in a way that he would have approved. I thank him. I thank you."

I produced pictures of which I am very proud and I'm preparing exciting and challenging new ones. The Academy honored me some five years ago with the Thalberg Award, and now this. In short, this industry has been exceedingly good to me. It has provided me with the opportunity to realize many of my most deeply felt creative and professional aspirations.  A natural extension of those involvements has been the acceptance of some of the responsibilities of good citizenship. It's been a privilege for me to participate in various professional, cultural and welfare activities of this industry and this community. I'm grateful for the opportunities that have been accorded for me to serve and I enjoy the fulfillments and the friendships they've brought me. I recommend them to others.  Now thanks to Pat, who encourages me; to Andrew and Larry, who forgive me; to Marvin and Jesse and Harold. And thanks to the Academy and its Board of Governors who continue to encourage excellence in our films and in our community."

I sometimes come to the Academy Awards and watch them year after year, and I get caught up in the spectacle of it, in the event, in the very complex type of entertainment and I guess, I know I forget, that what we're really here for is to single out who we think is the best for that given year. And if that's what I am to be this year then I appreciate it. I accept it with an honor and I'm very moved because of that.  I think we set out to make a film, a very truthful film, a very good film. I think Bruce Beresford, Horton Foote, the Hobels, EMI, should all be commended for a very wonderful job that they did in putting this film together. I think it's a valid film, valid enough that we have gotten very much applause of a certain kind from certain members of the country western community, such as my friend Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings. And this is certainly a very high level of criticism coming from those people. And if I didn't have that on one hand, I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete. But the combination of both tonight makes this a very complete and exciting evening for me tonight. And I want to thank the Academy very much for this award. I'm very happy. Thank you."

Thank you so much for terminating the suspense. Oh my, I am nervous.  I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this. You know, if 'Terms of Endearment' had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident. But I don't believe that anymore. I don't believe there's any such thing as accident. I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need. I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success. They're inseparable.  Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way. And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch. He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable. His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's. I guess we all did the same thing.  I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in 'Easy Pieces.' And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy. I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger. She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.  But in the end just let me say one thing. Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it. And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone. God bless that principle. God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it. I deserve this. Thank you."

We thank The Ladd Company, Alan Ladd, Jr., especially Gareth Wigan for his gentlemanly guidance, concern, care, all through the project. And before I give the microphone to my colleagues, I would like to say that we do thank our assistant editors and apprentice editors for their marvelous, dedicated support all through the project, who kept their sense of humor and carried us through to the end.  LISA FRUCHTMAN: 'The Right Stuff' required a monumental effort on the part of a lot of people, not all of whom we can thank tonight, but I'd like to just add to those already mentioned our producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were the first to see the possibilities for a terrific movie in Tom Wolfe's book. And again, our director Phil Kaufman, who transformed that book into a fantastic script and then into a fantastic movie from which we were able to work with terrific footage and whose vision carried us throughout the editing. For myself, I'd like to just thank my husband for his unwavering support during a difficult year and a half, and my colleagues Francis Coppola, Walter Murch and Bill Reynolds, without whose support and inspiration I wouldn't be here tonight. Thank you.  STEPHEN A. ROTTER: If I can just thank my wife Janet, my daughter Zoe, my good friend Dede Allen, and Phil and Rose. Thank you very much.

And I'm deeply appreciative to the Motion Picture Academy and its Board of Governors for choosing me to join such illustrious company as Frank Sinatra and the other past winners of the Jean Hersholt Award. Each of them has been a beacon to the rest of us in the motion picture industry and we have all gained in stature through their generosity, their caring, and their concern.  As I stand here tonight, I can't help but think that I lived and was brought up just a couple of blocks from here. I sold newspapers down the street on the corner of First and Broadway. I also think of all the people in our profession who I have learned from and who have helped me along the way. There was Doug Fairbanks, Sr. who gave me my first job in the motion pictures. And I was nine years old and I played a choirboy in a picture called 'Rosita.' Doug Fairbanks was a man who cared about kids and I liked him for that. I learned even more about caring and loving children from Joe E. Brown who was like a second father to me.  I owe a lot to my dear friend Leo Jaffe who brought me into the Columbia Pictures and who showed me that even when running a big company there was always enough time to help someone who needed help. And for my years in England I shall always remember the shining example from Lord Louis Mountbatten. I saw how much he loved children. I saw it first in India, in China, and during World War II. I saw it afterwards in the East End of London. And I learned what it meant to be gracious and to be compassionate from a beautiful actress, a beautiful star, and my leading lady for forty-four years, Binnie Barnes.  I would like to share this award with each of these people who I've spoken about who meant so much to me with all of you in the entertainment industry, especially the men and women of the Variety Clubs International, the greatest children's charity in the world. Thank you. Thank you very much."

GEORGE 'SPANKY' McFARLAND: Well, the nicest thing that ever happened to me, Mr. Roach, was when you hired me fifty-two years ago. But there was something that I never did ask you. What was Hollywood really like out here in 1912?  HAL ROACH: Oh, 1912. The first day that I worked in motion pictures I received a dollar a day, car fare and lunch. The car fare was two tokens, from in front of the post office downtown to Hollywood, one to take you there and one to bring you back to Los Angeles. The lunch was two sandwiches and a banana. And that is a little start of the 1912 business.  But I understand the thing has grown a little more expensive today and people are trying a little harder to save money in making pictures. And they're doing a lot of things to try to curtail the expense. And the only thing I can add to that is my experience in those days as far as making pictures were concerned.  For example, when a comedian for Mack Sennett did a 'Brodie' or fell on his rear, he fell on a cake of soap or a pile of oil or something like that, or something else, but anyway -- I got all screwed up to start with. I meant to say pratfall to start with. But anyway, the Hal Roach Studios did it a different way. You remember I said two sandwiches and a banana? Well, the property man after lunch would pick up all the banana skins and put 'em away for safekeeping. Then anytime that a Hal Roach comedian did a pratfall he slipped on the banana peel. And they slipped many times, and every time they did we used another thing. But the thing that was great about it was the fact that the bananas didn't cost me anything.  Just one thing in conclusion and that is this, that all these talented people that have been winning Oscars here tonight, they all make their money in an old-fashioned way. They earn it!"

What a wonderful and rewarding profession for a movie fan. Gregory Peck and Larry Gelbart asked me to speak for fifty-five minutes to make it a four-hour show but I only have thirty-two minutes prepared.  There're five pictures nominated this year. All had a curious relationship in the fact that the filmmakers who made them had to fight, and overcame many obstacles to make their films and to film their visions. One has to be proud to be a peer of the people who made 'Killing Fields,' 'Passage to India,' 'Soldier's Story' and 'Places in the Heart.'  Our thanks to Orion Pictures, and distributors and theater owners throughout the world who recognized 'Amadeus' before it was released. And thanks must be given to others because, regardless of what you might have heard or what you might think, I really didn't do it all myself. To Neville Marriner, Twyla Tharp, and Josef Svoboda, whose creative contributions to 'Amadeus' do not fit into any Academy category. To a marvelous group of actors whose talents no longer remain unsung. And to a Mike Hausman-led crew composed of Americans, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Italians, Czechs, and nine translators.  And my love to my children: Jon, Athena, Josh, Dorian. To the boys from Myrtle and Monroe. And to the gang up in Berkeley who were behind the picture all the way. Thank you very much."

Since I have always believed that cinema is the great communicator, I am that much more thankful for the unique experience and satisfaction of having been able to work in this medium. It also offered the added inspiration of collaborating with some of the greatest authors and playwrights and directors of this century, some here tonight but time doesn't allow me to recognize them. In composing music for film I attempt to achieve the following goals: To meet the demands and needs of the story conflict and the interrelationship of the characters involved, and also, hopefully, contributing my own personal comment.  I would like to make a humble plea to all of us involved in the movies, and that is to encourage and convey hope, humor, compassion, and adventure, and love, as opposed to despair, synthetic theatrics, and blatant, bloody violence. And sex, sex, sex, by all means, indeed, but with a bit of mystery, a touch of charm and elegance, and lots of imagination. Thank you."

I had a team of editors who locked themselves in a room with me seven days a week, twelve hours a day and behaved as though nothing else in the world existed. John Barry made it all sing. Karen Blixen lived that life and turned it into art and taught a generation a new way to write prose.

And I've had a lot of relatives that've been in a lot of wonderful things, and all I can say is, for the guys that have gone on before, that I love you and [kisses the Oscar] the family's got one. Thank you.  ZOLTAN ELEK: Now I start to believe my dream came true, which was a very long way from Hungary to here. But I have to thank to all those people who've been helping me and believe in me. Thank you again. Thank you."

Many have suffered and even died for this music, this greatest of all expression of the creative spirit of humankind—jazz. From their suffering and pain we can learn that life is the subject, the story that music so eloquently speaks of, and it is not the other way around. We as individuals must develop our lives to the fullest, to strengthen and deepen the story that others can be inspired by life's song.  I thank Bertrand Tavernier, Irwin Winkler, Francis Paudras, Dexter Gordon, Bruce Lundvall, William Flageollet and the cast and crew for their sincere efforts through love and respect for this American-born art form called jazz.

And to Dale Dye and the entire cast and crew of 'Platoon,' for their dedication. And particularly Oliver Stone, for his brilliance. I would not be here tonight but for Oliver Stone's brilliance, and I thank you, Oliver.  The power of the motion picture medium is awesome. 'Platoon' has brought to this generation a new perspective of war: That war is not glamorous, that it maims and it kills. And if perhaps 'Platoon' could also influence people in this and other countries of the world to hesitate before they engage in war, to demand facts and ask questions before the bombs, then we, not just those of us that made 'Platoon' but the entire motion picture industry, will have succeeded beyond our wildest imagination.

De Mille and George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock, William Wyler, Ingmar Bergman and Robert Wise, this award is truly a great honor for me. The Thalberg Award was first given fifty years ago in 1937, which was the year of 'In Old Chicago,' 'Captains Courageous,' 'Dead End,' 'The Life of Emile Zola,' 'Lost Horizon,' 'Stage Door' and 'A Star Is Born'—all having been nominated for Best Picture that year. I'm told Irving Thalberg worshipped writers. And that's where it all begins. That we are first and foremost storytellers, and without, as he called it, 'the photoplay,' everybody is simply improvising. He also knew that a script is more than just a blueprint. That the whole idea of movie magic is that interweave of powerful image and dialogue and performance and music that can never be separated, and when it's working right, can never be duplicated or ever forgotten.  I've grown up—most of my life has been spent in the dark watching movies. Movies have been the literature of my life. The literature of Irving Thalberg's generation was books and plays. They read the great words of great minds. And I think in our romance with technology and our excitement at exploring all the possibilities of film and video, I think we've partially lost something that we now have to reclaim. I think it's time to renew our romance with the word. I'm as culpable as anyone in having exalted the image of the word at the expense of...exalting the image at the expense of the word. But only a generation of readers will spawn a generation of writers.  The five films nominated for Best Picture this year are as much the writer's film as the director's. And it's good news that each of these films has found its audience. Because this audience, who we all work for, deserves everything we have to give them. They deserve that fifth draft, that tenth take, that one extra cut and those several dollars over budget. And Irving Thalberg knew that. He would have been proud to have been associated with any of these films, as I am proud to have my name on this award in his honor. Because it reminds me of really how much growth as an artist I have ahead of me in order to be worthy of standing in the company of those who have received this before me. So my deepest thanks to the Board of Governors of the Academy and the audience out there in the dark. Thank you very much."

And for this fellow [the Oscar] from all of the Academy, I just want to share it with all the good work that was done by all the branches, whether you were nominated or not tonight, but this is all with you.  A large part of this award belongs to Oliver Stone. And not only as the director, but having the courage to cast me in a part that not many people thought I could play. So I'll always be eternally grateful to him for that. And as a writer, Oliver, with Stanley Weiser, wrote a part that was the best part that I've ever had in my career. To Charlie and Martin Sheen, two wonderful actors that happen to be father and son, I thank them all very much for their help. Ed Pressman, Alex Ho, our producers; Leonard Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Tom Sherak of Fox, I thank you, too.  I'd like to dedicate this award to William Darrid, Diana Douglas-Darrid, Anne Douglas and Kirk Douglas, my parents and step-parents, who have been extremely supportive and loving to me over the years.

I would like you to take this [removes trophy from the podium and hands it to Jack Lemmon] because I have a feeling this is gonna break.  I would especially like to thank—after having thanked the governors of the Academy and the members, and all the millions of fans I have all over the world, in the civilized parts of the world—I would very much like to thank one specific gentleman without whose help I would not be standing here tonight. I have forgotten his name but I have never forgotten his compassion. He was the American consul in Mexicali, Mexico.  Now, imagine it's 1934. It's a year after the Hitler putsch. We are all in exile: Zurich, London, Paris. Then I get lucky. I sell a story to Hollywood and I get the visitor's visa for six months. Then I come here and start working, but six months go by very, very fast. Well, I don't want to leave. I would like to stay in America. So, I am being told that I need an immigration visa, for which reason you—I mean, you have to leave the country, get the immigration visa and then come back in order to re-enter with the proper papers. So I go to Mexicali which is the closest American consulate right across the border from California. And as they showed me into the office of the consul I was drenched in sweat. It was not the heat. It was just the panic, the fear. I knew that I needed a whole bunch of documents: affidavits, official proof of former residence, sworn testaments that I had never been a criminal or an anarchist. I had nothing, zilch. Just my passport and my birth certificate and some letters from a few American friends vouching that I was harmless. It looked hopeless.  The consul—he looked a little bit like Will Rogers—examined my meager documentation. 'Is that all you have?' he asked. And I said, 'Yes.' I have to explain that, you know, I had to get out of Berlin on very short notice, like twenty minutes. A neighbor had tipped me off that two men in uniform had been looking for me. I had just enough time to throw in a few things in the suitcase and get on a night train to Paris. The consul just stared at me and said, 'I mean, how do you expect me to, with just those papers?' And I told him, I tried to get them from Nazi Germany but they just would not respond. Of course I could get them if I went back to Germany, then they would put me naturally on the train and ship me off to Dachau. So, he just kept staring and staring at me and I was not sure whether I was getting through to him. I have heard of whole families who have spent years there waiting for the visa and other guys who never got in. And believe me, I wanted to get back to America. It looked bad.  So we just sat there and stared at each other, the consul and I, in total silence. Finally he asked me, 'What do you do? I mean professionally?' And I said, 'I write movies.' And he said, 'That so?' He got up and started pacing, kind of behind me, but I felt that he was measuring me. Then he came back to the desk, picked up my passport, opened it, and took a rubber stamp and went [thumps twice on the podium], handed me back the passport and he said, 'Write some good ones.'  That was fifty-four years ago. I've tried ever since. I certainly did not want to disappoint that dear man in Mexicali. And you know, as I look back, you know, I've lived a charmed life. I never expected something like this, like the Thalberg Award. You are without any doubt the most generous people in the world. And I hope you're watching, I. A. L., because part of this is yours. So get well, will you? Thank you very, very much."

In particular, in London I'd like to thank my assistants Frank Gardiner and Gilly Hebden and Joyce Herlihy. In Rome, the marvelous Ugo Pericoli who did the military uniforms, Mario Cotone and Thomas Casterline. And finally I would like to thank Jeremy Thomas for his fearless commitment and energy in getting this project off the ground.

Something fascinating, very remote. Something I really didn't belong to. Then one day 'The Last Emperor' got nine nomination and everything change immediately. I became immediately a kind of Oscar victim. I started to learn the rule of the game and to take, to check the odds, started the colitis, and the beta blockers, the Inderal, all these things. I mean, I became a kind of Oscar victim.  I want to do a Chinese kowtow to the Academy because this is one of the strongest emotion of my life and I can't hide it. I want to thank the Chinese who allowed me to shoot in their beautiful country. And the Chinese emperor, John Lone, the Chinese empress, Joan Chen. And all the wonderful people who gave me their creativity in front, behind and around the camera. I can't name all of them; they're wonderful. And I was just thinking that if New York is the big apple, to me Hollywood tonight is the big nipple. Thank you very much."

A thank you to Michael Shamberg, the producer of 'A Fish Called Wanda,' who got me together, oh, six or seven years ago with John Cleese, and he said, 'I want to write a movie where you get run over by a steamroller and eat of a lot of Michael Palin's tropical fish.' I said, 'Great, sounds good. I'm in. Let's do it.' And then he actually wrote it.  I'd like to thank the Academy for naming me in this group of most distinguished actors, the five nominees. I share this with you. I would like to thank John Cleese for writing this brilliant script, for his generosity, for his friendship. To my fellow actors, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis. To Jonathan Benson. To Charlie Crichton, who at seventy-seven proves that even with twenty or twenty-five years off there's no such thing as growing old when you've got a dream. He's the best. Thank you very much for this. And I'd like to thank my wife Phoebe. Thanks."

And to all those fighting AIDS, especially the gay and lesbian community, thank you for leading the nation with courage and dignity and urgency. May our government soon follow.  BILL COUTURIÉ: Sometimes those of us that make documentaries can feel that Hollywood doesn't have a heart. Our film's proof that it did. Sandy Gallin, Howard Rosenman, Carol Baum, all the people at Sandollar, Home Box Office, CAA, and especially Cis Wilson—this is for you. And Kathy, for telling me, 'You gotta make a film on the quilt.' Honey, you were right. Thank you.  JEFFREY FRIEDMAN: Thank you!"

And thank all of you for your...what you've just done [standing ovation]. I think I lost what I was going to say because I've never had a moment like this, and I'm much better behind the camera.  It seems strange to receive an award for living your life. What has ever seemed special to others that I may have done was only a part of my life: a life I have with my family at home, my life that I have with my family at work. I love what I do, I really do. It's great to be in this industry. My life has been its own reward. For you to add such a special honor this evening, well, there simply are no words.  My Paramount family—and my family's crying right there right now. Come on. My Paramount family, which I've been part of for the last twenty-six years, where they called me Doctor Koch, and my own family. My wife Ruth, who I love and adore, and without you I'd still be saying to Mervyn LeRoy, 'I'm ready when you are, Mr. LeRoy!” But I love you. And my daughter, my lovely daughter Melinda, who anyone would be proud to have for a daughter. And her Alan, handsome guy. Howard, Jr., who hopefully will be standing right on this stage one day receiving his Oscar. And all my grandchildren are here tonight. Now, wait a minute, I can't remember. Wally, help me with this. Let's see, there's Wendy and her Tim, Carol, Robby, and Billy the 'Northwestern flash.' There you are, Billy. My sister Lola—oh, I forgot Emily! I told you! Come back, roll it back. And my granddaughter Emily. Emily, the most beautiful one in the family. I'm sorry. My sister Lola, and before I forget, my secretary Laurie, who rewrote every letter I dictated and made it better. That's true, Laurie, wherever you are. And you know, there's an old saying that it's more blessed to give than receive. But tonight, if I may, it's more blessed to receive. Thank you. And thank you, Aubrey: It's steady ole Peddie!"

I would like to thank everyone associated with 'Misery': Columbia Pictures, Castle Rock, Andy Scheinman, Rob Reiner for giving me a chance. I'd like to thank William Goldman for bringing the wonderful, crazy 'Annie Wilkes' to the screen and Stephen King for thinking of her in the first place. I would like to thank Jimmy Caan and apologize publicly for the ankles. And I would like to say that I really am your number one fan, Jimmy. I would like to thank the cast and the crew of 'Misery.' They're incredible. They were a pleasure to work with. And I would like to thank my friends watching from New York at the Sea Palace on 9th Avenue. And I would like to thank my family, my friends, my mom at home, and my dad who I hope is watching somewhere. I would like to say thank you. Thank you very much."

The editors of the film: Larry Silk, Tom Haneke, Cathy Caplan. The cameramen: Kevin Keating, Hart Perry, Peter Gilbert.

I will never forget what happened here tonight. My family will never forget what happened here. My Native American brothers and sisters across the country, especially the Lakota Sioux, will never forget. People I went to school with will never forget. 'Dances With Wolves' won this year, and while it's not as important as the rest of the world situation where it sits, it will always be important to us, and we thank you for this."

My wife and partner, Lili, who has brought so much inspiration into my life. And to my father, who taught me so much and who gave me such an early opportunity. Thank you very much.

Frankly, I'm simply overwhelmed. Simply, I'm frankly overwhelmed!  And yet I must add that I am also grateful to both Zanucks, Darryl and Dick. Darryl brought me to Hollywood, and I had the good fortune and longevity to continue the Zanuck connection through the many years Dick and I shared as partners and close friends. We intend to continue to justify the accolade the Academy's Governors have bestowed on us and hope to be worthy of the distinguished company in which they have placed us.

You know, there are times when you reach a certain age plateau where the producers say, they talk about you and they say, 'Well, what do you think? Can we risk it? Can we do it? Can we use him?' The other guy says, 'I don't know, let's look at some younger ones. We can make them look older, but this one, you know, it's kind of difficult.' They forget, they forget to ask that you go out there and you do all these…things. Like for instance, you know, [leaves podium] you go out there, you do these one-arm push-ups. [Does three one-arm push-ups on stage; returns to podium.] That's nothing, really. As far as the two-handed push-ups are concerned, you can do that all night and it doesn't make any difference whether she's there or not. And besides, it's a hell of a lot less expensive.  Wow. You know, a long time ago in 1949, first picture, 1949, first film, I'd been shooting about two weeks and the producer came to me and he said, 'Jack' – my name at that time was Vladimir, but he called me Jack. He says, 'Jack, you're going to win the Academy Award.' Can you believe it? Forty-two years later he was right. How the son of a bitch knew?! Thank you."

And at this moment, all of those sort of doleful memories have suddenly transformed themselves into nothing more than the sort of charming and amusing anecdotes for my memoirs! I cannot, cannot thank you enough.  There are a few people I'd like to thank with all my heart, very quickly. The great Terry Gilliam. Richard LaGravenese, our screenwriter. An extraordinary cast; it was an honor to work with them. Roger Pratt, our cinematographer. Steve Randall, Lynda Obst, Debra Hill, Howard Feuer, Marsha McManus. My family and my close friends, for their patience and their respect and their support.

When I was a small, small school boy, I was terribly interested in the cinema. Became a film fan, wrote to Deanna Durbin. Got a reply, was delighted. Wrote to Ginger Rogers, didn't get a reply. Then of course, I got interested in the cinema as an art form, and I wrote a twelve-page letter to Billy Wilder after seeing 'Double Indemnity.' He didn't reply either. Well, there you are. I have learned everything I've learned about the craft of cinema from the making of American films. I've been watching American films very carefully over the years and I loved them for what they entertain, and then later loved them for what they taught. So, I express my gratitude to the American cinema, to the motion picture association who have given me this award and who have made me feel so proud. Thank you very, very much."

Movies are not made in isolation; it's a group activity. And it's only because of the work, the very hard work, of many actors, writers, directors, producers, creative technicians, thousands of assistants of all kinds, and projectionists, that I'm able to stand here and accept this award. I'm very, very grateful to them all.  I'd especially like to thank a group of devoted individuals who, apart from my parents, have done the most to shape my life: my teachers. From kindergarten through college their struggle—and it was a struggle—to help me learn to grow and learn was not in vain, and it is greatly appreciated. I've always tried to be aware of what I say in my films because all of us who make motion pictures are teachers, teachers with very loud voices. But we will never match the power of the teacher who is able to whisper in a student's ear. Thank you, Francis, for being my mentor. And finally, thanks to my current and most important teachers, my two daughters. They have taught me more and enriched my life beyond anything imaginable. After twenty years this award comes at what I hope is the halfway point in my career, and I assure you that I will strive to be worthy of all it signifies. Thank you very, very much."

And also to be able to work with such an ensemble cast of actors: with Jodie and Tony of course, and also Ted Levine for his exceptionally courageous performance as 'Jame Gumb,' and Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith and Diane Baker, and all the other wonderful actors.  I also—this won't take forever, sorry—I also had the extraordinary good fortune to have been embraced by Orion Pictures at a time which, unlike this amazing peak moment of my life, I was at a kind of low-valley moment when Mike Medavoy and Bill Bernstein and Arthur Krim and Eric Pleskow kind of reached out to me and encouraged me and helped create a home for my collaborators and myself. And we made some movies for them. And I'll never forget when Mike Medavoy said, 'I think there's a book you might be interested in. I'll send it over.' And it's obvious, I know everybody feels the extraordinary irony of what's happened, this terrible thing that's happened to Orion at a moment of re-emergence that included 'Silence of the Lambs' and many other things.  Anyway, two other quick things. I'm sorry, this is almost—one, just about directing. I wanted very much to salute John Singleton and Matty Rich and Jodie Foster and Ernest Dickerson and a bunch of new people in the last year that have come on with very exciting, wonderful visions and really breathed tremendously important new life into our whole cinematic landscape. And I really want to salute those people very strongly. I also want to very, very quickly—I had the good fortune of being encouraged and briefed by two great American filmmakers who are no longer with us. And I very much, I'm thrilled to be able to invoke the recent memory of two great men, two great filmmakers: Hal Ashby and Martin Ritt, who were really, really wonderful to me.  And finally, I've obviously got to say, 'Hi, Mom,' and thanks for transferring your love of movies to me. And thanks, Dad, for making me think I could actually be part of this industry.

Gil [Cates], I need a teleprompter. I feel like John Wayne and I'm ten feet tall. In addition to the Demme family and the Orion family, I want to thank my family: my wife who's been the star of our family for fifty years, Angie; and to our son Tim in Vermont, and his family; and to our daughter Robin, and my partner, Robin Fajardo, in New York; thank you very much.

I kept going into my pocket for a speech, but I never wrote one. But now I got one. It's here, and I should have had a little water before I got on because my mouth's dry. But I thank you and I just have to say...  First, I don't know where he is in the house, I can't pick him out, but I got to thank him. I'm completely indebted to Marty Brest who directed the picture and who had such great love for this character I played. And that love is what he communicated to me every day, so I thank you, Marty, for that. I thank Bo Goldman, who wrote such a complicated, interesting, funny guy that could be and would be any actor's dream part. That part was so great. I thank Chris O'Donnell, my co-star in this. He made every day a pleasure for me. And I thank the wonderful support of cast and crew, of course. I also want to thank Tom Pollock and Casey Silver at Universal Pictures, and my agent Rick Nicita who urged me to do this part and actually threatened me if I didn't do it, 'cause I didn't want to do the part for some reason. Ira Lewis, my friend and my colleague, who helped me, Ira Lewis. And The Associated Blind for their generous support to me.  If you'll indulge me for a minute—I'm just not used to this, so I had to write this down. I had this thought, and I thought if I ever got up here I would say it. I've been very lucky. I found desire for what I do early in my life and I'm lucky because I had people who encouraged that desire, from Lee Strasberg, to my great friend and mentor Charlie Laughton, to the great writers and filmmakers that I've been fortunate enough to work with. Now, recently a young girl came up to me. I was at a function for the South Bronx, which is where I'm from. And she said that I had encouraged her, and that's not necessarily by my work but just by the fact that we came from the same place. And I just can't forget that girl, and I can't forget the kids out there who may be thinking tonight that if he can do it, I can do it. So this is really a proud and hopeful moment for me, because I want to thank the Academy for giving us a gift of encouragement. And this is a gift, a great gift to me. I thank you all, really.

And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts: to E. M.

Actually, I think I might have to give back the money. And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation. To a superlative cast and crew. To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment. And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life.

And I would very much like to pay a great tribute to them, because in Ismail we found a constructive and enthusiastic and encouraging producer, and in Jim a charismatic and meticulous director who believes in the visual importance of the film and who brooks no compromise.

And David Peoples' fabulous script. Warner Bros., for sticking with this film. The film critics, for discovering this film. It wasn't a highly tout[ed] film when it came out but they sort of stayed with it throughout the year. The French film critics who embraced some of my work very early in the game, the British Film Institute, the Museum of Modern Art are some of the people that were there long before I ever became fashionable.

We'd like to take a moment and dedicate this film to all the people who have worked so hard for justice and truth and peace around the world. And particularly the four people who have died who were working in association with this film, and the hundreds and possibly thousands of Panamanians who died in this invasion, whose stories might never otherwise be told because of the deceptive practices and tactics of our government with the complicity—I don't like it either, but it's the way it is—with the complicity of the major media.  We would like to also dedicate the film to the courageous Panamanian journalists and human rights activists who have defied the Panamanian ban against the screening of this film, at personal risk, to show it in the last few weeks in Panama, which, by the way, reversed the censorship ban which was nationwide. And to the millions of Americans who may or may not get to see this film now that public TV has also refused a broadcast.  In closing, I'd just like to say we have a tremendous amount of potential in the world and those of us here have a tremendous amount of potential to impact the world. Let's use it.

And that at the end of each of our lives, we can look back and be proud that we have treated others with the kindness, dignity and respect that every human being deserves. Thank you and God bless."

I always thought that was one of the things popular art was supposed to be about, along with the merchandising and all the other stuff.

And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine, we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth. I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late. And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for. And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with.  I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening. Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson. I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age. I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.  And there lies my dilemma here tonight. I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight. They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all. A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago. God bless you all. God have mercy on us all. And God bless America."

So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.  And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you. Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now. And that is such a gift. And Michael Nyman, who really gave me a veritable instruction manual for a way into 'Ada McGrath' by giving the music, giving me the music that he gave me and the entire movie to experience. And Jan Chapman, our producer, for being so luminous and for giving 'The Piano' and all of us a place to flourish.

And in the nation there are a group of communities, and one of those communities is the community of artists and entertainers, and I think they are the most generous community in the United States. And not just in terms of money, but in terms of inspiration and effort and time and commitment and risk. So to be singled out like this, out of that community, I must say is an honor indeed.

I implore all the educators who are watching this program to please, do not allow the Holocaust to remain a footnote in history. Please teach this in your schools. There are 350,000 experts who just want to be useful with the remainder of their lives. Please listen to the words and the echoes and the ghosts, and please teach this in your schools. Thank you very, very much for this. Thank you.  GERALD R. MOLEN: Just very quickly, thank you to the Academy, to a brilliant cast, and a marvelous international crew. To my wife Pat for sharing the magic for the past forty years. And to Steven Spielberg for your courage and dedication of purpose that has given each and every one of us such a special and marvelous gift.  BRANKO LUSTIG: My number was 83317. I am a Holocaust survivor. It's a long way from Auschwitz to this stage. I want to thank everyone who helped me to come so far. People died in front of me in the camps. Their last words were: 'Be a witness of my murder. Tell the world how I died. Remember.' Together with Gerry, by helping Steven to make this movie I hope I fulfill my obligation to the innocent victims of the Holocaust. In the name of the six million Jews killed in the Shoah and other Nazi victims, I want to thank everyone for acknowledg[ing] this movie. Thank you."

I'd like to particularly thank the subject of this film, Maya Lin, for her extraordinary gift to this country in designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It's an idea that would not have happened had it not been for the courage and sacrifice of Vietnam veterans. And I'd like to thank the veterans for their service to this country and particularly two vets, Jan Scruggs and Robert Doubek, who had tenacity against great political opposition to build that beautiful memorial. I need to thank some great crew members, a wonderful team, great cinematographers Don Lenzer and Eddie Marritz, composer Charles Bernstein, William T. Cartwright, and my daughters Jessica and Brittany Sanders, and uhm... Time's up, I think. Yep, time's up. NEA great!"

Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey. There were many people who gave him gifts along the way. Eric Roth, you gave 'Forrest' a soul. Tom Hanks, you gave 'Forrest' a heart. And Bob Zemeckis, you gave 'Forrest' a vision. Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents. 'Forrest' was a labor of love to many people: our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand. To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support. To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality. My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will. Thank you.  STEVE TISCH: All over the political map people have been calling 'Forrest' their own. But 'Forrest Gump' isn't about politics or conservative values. It's about humanity. It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love. And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower. I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends. And finally, thanks to all the 'Forrest Gumps' in the world.  STEVE STARKEY: Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight. Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of 'Forrest Gump,' but maybe as 'Forrest' said: 'Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time.' But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios. But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis. And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done. And hello to my parents. Thank you all very much."

They were my boyhood idols as far as filmmakers. And a lot of them were directors, producers -- and just straight producers -- and they were experts. These people had a great influence and they were experts in a business that has very few experts, really. In fact, if anybody asked me about making films I would say that it's probably a little expertise and a lot of luck. Now, how I fit into that equation? Well, if 'Dirty Harry,' if I was in his sights and he said, 'Do you feel lucky?' I'd say, 'You're damn right I do.' Thank you. Thank my family. Thank everyone."

You may have seen my mother Sarah in my music and witnessed the laughter and tears of my children, of my family.

When, in 1931, I came stumbling out of Chouinard Art Institute into the arid maelstrom of the Great Depression in the wan hope that I could resume my school career as a janitor, a miracle occurred so staggeringly unexpected and unbelievable that I find it incredible even today. Somebody offered to pay me to draw. And so this miracle continues. For nearly seventy years I've been paid adequately, if not lavishly, for doing what I enjoy doing most. A miracle indeed. Robert Frost expresses it best: 'My object in life,' he said, 'is to unite my avocation and my vocation, as my two eyes are one in sight.'

I have got to thank the members of the Academy for this, for including me in this group of super talents and for helping me blur the line between art and commerce with this award. I know it's not hip to say it, but I just love acting, and I hope that there'll be more encouragement for alternative movies where we can experiment and fast forward into the future of acting.  Let me thank the awesome, multi-talented Mike Figgis. My incredible, amazing co-star Elisabeth Shue. I am going to share this award with both of you and the late John O'Brien, whose spirit moved me so much. Tony Dingman, Annie Stewart -- the producers, Annie Stewart and Stuart Regen, everyone at MGM/UA and Lumiere. I'd like to thank Ed Limato, my colleagues Gerry Harrington, Jeff Levine, Richard Lovett. Everyone in my family, my gorgeous wife Patricia. And I just finally want to say: Hi, Weston. It's Daddy. I love you. Thank you."

The person who pulls the strings, the person who manipulates, who hovers over us, who gives us life and breath. For me 'Keyser Soze' is Bryan Singer, the director of this film. And I thank him for his friendship, and for giving me an extraordinary part, and for making me a better actor than I ever thought I could be. I've dreamed of a moment like this my whole life. I thank my manager Joanne, my agent Brian Gersh. And on a personal note to my mother, I'm so proud that you can be here tonight. Thank you so much -- [applause].

All those mothers and fathers without whose strong performances the film would not have been as balanced and had as much dignity as it did, I thank you for that.

Thanks for being such good sports, and who were in the movie and did a great job. And finally, to my partner in crime and in all things of the heart, the writer, the producer, the director, the spirit, Tim Robbins. You kept us on track, you fought so hard.

And everyone at Icon. Paramount and Fox, who both went in, they double dipped, Sherry Lansing, Jon Dolgen, Barry London, Peter Chernin, Bill Mechanic, Jim Gianopulos. It's one of the best cast and crews I've ever worked with. John Toll, who's already been honored here tonight. Tom Sanders, Charles Knode, Steve Rosenblum, David Tomblin -- thanks for dragging me through the mud sometimes. James Horner, Mic Rodgers, Simon Crane, and the clan Wallace. We mustn't forget the clan Wallace. Nigel Sinclair, Ed Limato, Jeff Berg, Alan Nierob, Paul Bloch, Rod Lurie, my wife and family for indulging me. And God, for indulging me in this tiny moment. And every director I've ever worked with, they were my film school. And now that I'm a bona fide director with a golden boy, I uh, well, like most directors I suppose what I really want to do is act.

'Toy Story' was a labor of love that took over four years to complete. And even though it's the first computer-animated feature film, computers alone did not create 'Toy Story,' a group of very talented people did, among them -- all right, time me, Robin -- Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Joe Ranft, Ralph Guggenheim, Bonnie Arnold, Bill Reeves, Eban Ostby, Ralph Eggleston, Peter Schneider, Tom Schumacher, Michael Eisner, and everyone at Pixar. Also...  ROBIN WILLIAMS [interrupting]: The United Rhythm Foundation, please help!  JOHN LASSETER: ...And also my loving wife Nancy and my lucky stars, my sons, Joey, Bennet, PJ and Sam.

Before I came I went to visit Jane Austen's grave in Winchester Cathedral to pay my respects, you know, and to tell her about the grosses. And I don't know how she would react to an evening like this but I do hope, I do hope she knows how big she is in Uruguay. Profound thanks to Columbia Pictures and the lovely forms of Lisa Henson, Gareth Wigan, and Mark Canton for hiring a first-time writer. To James Schamus, for his rare intelligence. And to Sydney Pollack, for asking all the right questions like, why couldn't these women go out and get a job? Why, indeed! And to the cast and crew, for being impeccable. To my friend and my teacher, Lindsay Doran, for being the single, most frustrating reason why I can't claim all the credit for myself. And finally I would like, with your permission, to dedicate this Oscar to our director Ang Lee. Ang, wherever you are, this is for you."

For once stop being Mr. Bah Humbug and try to enjoy it, at least for your family and friends' sake. Well, she's not only beautiful, she's right. So, Shelah, and Matthew, Amy, Kris, and Susan -- and even Julie [Andrews] who calls me an old curmudgeon -- and the many friends who wrote or phoned with the same message, once the reality of all this sinks in I promise to enjoy it. I've even had my glasses tinted slightly rose-colored.  So many of today's films stress the terrors that await us. Perhaps this award signifies an awareness that we have been missing something, namely the vitality and the joy of living that movie musicals can express in song and dance. I thank the Academy for this tribute. I accept it in the name of all choreographers and especially the dancers who made it all possible. We feel honored. Thank you."

The Academy has honored me by choosing to seat me as 'David Helfgott' at a table with 'Larry Flynt' and 'Count Laszlo de Almásy' and 'Karl Childers' and 'Jerry Maguire.' I can't quite imagine where the conversation might head that night, but it has really enriched me as an actor to be seated at that table.  I want to thank Scott Hicks and all of the 'Shine' team for giving me the chance to have a glimpse of the bird of paradise. Scott, thank you. My darling wife Jane, I wouldn't be standing here without you, and to Merle and John, my mum and stepdad in Queensland. And to the unstoppable David Helfgott. The front of my script said that this story was inspired by the events of your life. You truly are an inspiration.

And I encourage writers and directors to keep these really interesting female roles coming, and while you're at it you can throw in a few for the men as well.  My family, friends and colleagues here tonight and all around the world, they know exactly who they are, you know who you are. And I hope you already know how much your support and your care means to me, but I'm gonna name three. The co-writer/director and producer of 'Fargo,' Mr. Ethan Coen, who helped make an actor of me.

I'd like to talk to [you] for a minute about passion. Don't move around in your chairs, or change the station on your TV set, as the following words will be innocent. Darryl Zanuck, Hal Wallis, David Selznick, Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn are among the giants who were the early recipients of this award. All are recognized as producers who brought passion to their films. And they were really bound together by their love of moviemaking. Passion is [the] immeasurable, indescribable factor that separates movie from movie. Passion moves freely across borders, speaks every language and flourishes in every culture. The movement of passion is the most gratifying satisfaction in any moviemaker's life. This happens when you see and hear people all over the world share their laughter, their crying and their sudden gasps at identical screen moments. Samuel Hoffenstein, a poet and screenwriter, poetically wrote, 'The Holy Grail is not in the finding, it is in the journey.' The Irving Thalberg Award memorializes a giant among giants who brought us a sense of film history. This belongs to the many with whom I have shared dreams and journeys. My cup is full. Thank you."

For the script you get Larry Gelbart, or Peter Stone, or Huyck and Katz, or Frederic Raphael -- like that. If it's a musical, for the songs you get George and Ira Gershwin, or Arthur Freed and Herb Brown, or Leonard Bernstein and Comden and Green, or Alan Lerner and Fritz Loewe -- like that.

I can't act and I can't compose and I can't do visual effects, so I guess that's why I'm producing. But I have a lot of people that I have to thank on behalf of both Jim and myself. I want to thank all the nominees here this evening, and all the people that again they've already thanked. Our incredible cast, we would not be here without you. My wife Julie, my sons Jamie and Jody. Rae Sanchini, who is absolutely one of the best people in this industry. My mom and dad, Edie and Ely. And now a run through our quick list of credits here: Josh McLaglen, Mali Finn, Gig Rackauskas, Simon Crane, Jimmy Muro, John Buckley, Lloyd Moriarity, Charles Lee, Martin Laing, Roger Barton, Charlie Arneson, Steve Quayle, Kevin De LaNoy, Lance Julian, Roger Hanna, Tommy Gordon, Les Collins, Tony Graysmark, Doug Fenton, Harry Heeks, Randy Gerston, Grant Hill, Sharon Mann and Anna Roth. This movie would not have been made except for the conviction and belief of Peter Chernin, Bill Mechanic, Tom Sherak, Jim Gianopulos, Tom Rothman, Sanford Panitch, Vicki Rossellini, Ted Gagliano, Mike Jenkinson, Jim Darbirian, Hilary Clark*, Jon Dolgen, Sherry Lansing, Rob Friedman, John Goldwyn, Arthur Cohen, Wayne Lewellen, Nancy Goliger, Blaise Noto, Greg Brilliant, John Rentsch, Allison Jackson, Maren Moebius, and Steve Panama*. We would not be here without an incredible screenwriter who wrote a great script, Jim Cameron.  JIM CAMERON: I think Jon saw 'Shine' too many times. He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say. And my eyes are still sort of doing pinwheels from the last one, so I just want to say a couple of things. We're here tonight to celebrate the magic of movies. And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it. And tonight has been such a great celebration for us. And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with 'Titanic,' where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie. And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.  In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912. So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here. I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died. The message of 'Titanic' of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today. Life is precious. So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world. Join me please in a few seconds of silence for 'Titanic' . . . . Thank you very much. That's about as much as I'm sure Gil Cates can stand. All right, you've really made this a night to remember in every way. Now let's go party till dawn."

We also want to thank Evelyn Lipper, Anne Marie Stein, and of course October Films and Good Machine for getting this film seen around the world. And last but not least, certainly but not least, our executive producer Steven Spielberg, for his strength of character and his vision in establishing the Shoah Foundation, videotaping more than 50,000 survivor testimonies all over the world and ensuring through those testimonies and through this film that survivors will have a voice for generations to come.

I want to thank at Disney: Michael Eisner and Joe Roth, who've given me great latitude and great support. At Universal: Edgar Bronfman, Ron Meyer, Stacey, Nadia Bronson, Chris McGurk. At Miramax: My brilliant Meryl Poster, my head of production who rocks the universe and makes us look good. Oh man, Julie Goldstein, who is the most persevering, brilliant executive producer. To Bob Osher, to Mark Gill and Marcy Granata, who are the one and two most dynamite marketing team.  DONNA GIGLIOTTI: And your brother Bob...  HARVEY WEINSTEIN: I'm getting there, okay. I don't know, we made this movie -- this is a movie about life and art. And art and life combining is called magic. For me, this was a great experience, a passion, for five years. And nobody inspires me more than my brother Bob, who is my partner and best friend every day.

Well, Irving, you're one heavy dude. I'll tell you that... You want to hold him? He's about twenty pounds!  There's a lot of people to thank, of course, but Irving once said that brevity is a great virtue. So, I accept this great honor tonight in the names of all those people who have contributed to my work, my life's work. Forty years ago, I sat at William Wyler's feet and tried to learn how to make movies. And Willy Wyler was a god to me, and he won this award. And I think that's what is so meaningful to me, to join all those filmmakers that have gone before. I would like to thank my immediate loved ones, my family, every actor, writer, editor, cinematographer, production designer, costume designer, sound man and editor I've ever worked with. All those crews in Europe and Canada and the United States.  And my one real regret about winning this prize is that, you know, it's not like the Nobel or the Pulitzer. I mean, the Thalberg Award comes with no money attached. If it did, if it did, I would share it with the Canadian Film Centre and the AFI where the next generation of filmmakers are preparing to entertain the world in the new millennium. And my parting thought to all those young filmmakers is this: Just find some good stories. Never mind the gross, the top ten, bottom ten, what's the rating, what's the demographic. You know something, the biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, I want to tell you something. So just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears, and perhaps reveal a little truth about ourselves. And as for myself, I hope to see you again next year!"

This movie to me is all about how any single act from any single person put out of context is damnable. But the joy of this movie is that it is real beauty. We found real beauty in this extraordinary script by Sam Mendes -- by Alan Ball. It feels like he wrote it though, doesn't it?  I am very proud to be an actor, and I have tried very hard to protect my work; and I am stunned and a bit speechless.

I want to thank the Academy for their support and recognition of me and my work in a movie that is so important, and I am so proud to be a part of it.  This movie would have never been made -- I had, just on the off chance that I got up here, I brought this piece of paper because I knew I couldn't forget anyone, because everyone put their heart and soul into this movie and God knows no one got paid. So first, Kimberly Peirce, for her fierce tenacity and vision. Andy Bienen, our co-writer. Killer Films, you guys always make important movies and I thank you for that. John Hart, Jeff Sharp, for being there for me every single minute. Jim Denault, our cinematographer, who was absolutely brilliant. Kerry Barden, Jennifer McNamara, for fighting for me, the casting directors. Chloë Sevigny, the rest of the cast, who portrayed their characters so honestly and brilliantly. Lee Percy, our editor.  I want to thank Michael Stremel, Lindsay Law and Bill Mechanic and everyone at Fox Searchlight for putting their wing around this small, little movie and giving us wings. Larry Moss, my acting coach, who, without him, I could have never given this performance. Thank you, Larry. My mom, who's up there somewhere [in the balcony]. It looks like living out of our car was worth it. Holly Hein, for keeping my head on straight. My publicist Troy Nankin, who is a beautiful, beautiful human being. Kami Putnam, I have to thank you for fighting for me. I'm almost done, I promise. The Independent Film Channel, for helping us finish our movie. And Hylda Queally and David Wirtschafter, for their support.  And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank Brandon Teena for being such an inspiration to us all. His legacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not conform. I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences, but we actually celebrate our diversity. Thank you very much."

I can't tell you what a great experience it has been working with this team from DreamWorks. The producers, Dan, and you've seen your moments, Bruce. From a script that I didn't know how we were going to get a movie that anybody liked because they were such unusual characters, until Sam pointed out to me, don't you ever have any unusual thoughts yourself, Conrad, about sixteen-year-old girls that accompany your daughter home? And I thought, oh well... So, I guess we're all part of a wonderful, wonderful, dysfunctional family called the human race, and the 'Fittses' and the 'Burnhams' and everybody else partakes of it. But my best family is here tonight. They're my children, my grandchildren, and whose love has supported me all these years.  I know I am going to forget something and I don't know what it is. The team that I had working with me, Aaron Pazanti, Clyde Bryan and Suzanne Trucks and my son Conrad -- Conrad W. -- who shot some additional scenes for us, and David Golia. What a great time it was working. Sam, you're the best. When you showed up looking exactly like Orson Welles I thought to myself, oh my God. And now I know he's like Orson Welles.

And one thing I have learned about film writing is how communal it is. And the reason people give thanks is because there's so many people that had so much to do with this film and with the music. From Peter Gelb from Sony Classics who introduced me to François Girard, the wonderful director of this film, and Niv Fichman the producer. But then you have to go to the voice of the violin and say, you know, you can write all the notes you want, but if someone doesn't play them like a god they'll never sound that way.

To have known that I was going to get it, particularly this year with all the... It's been very helpful around the house. I must say that if you had your choice and you could get the Thalberg Award or the White House, I think I'd stick with this. I don't want to talk politics here and I don't want to suggest some direction that the movies should go into, but I think I would like to, if I may, pay tribute to the memory of my mother Kathlyn, my father Ira, and to the people who nurtured me as a child in Virginia with my sister Shirley, and beginning with Stella Adler and Elia Kazan, and to all the people who worked with me and taught me.  I came to Hollywood when I was in my early twenties. Many of the previous winners of this award actually taught me. You know, Sam Goldwyn was in his eighties, God bless him, and he treated me like a grown-up. Now it's very interesting, I think that most of the people who are teaching me now, they all seem to be in their early twenties and I do whatever I can to keep them -- I try to get them to stop treating me like a grown-up. But I thank them, I thank them.  I thank my profession for giving me freedom and access. The freedom to live a much fuller life apart from the movies, and the access to get out and get to know the world and then come back and go back to making movies. Please forgive me for not making more of them. I'll try to do better. Thank you so much for encouraging my voice in public affairs. Please forgive me if I've used it stridently, or in fact not often enough. I'll try to do better. To my fellow actors, I would like to say thank you. Thank you for making me look good. I'm first, last, and always an actor, my pride in that is unbounded. Please forgive me for being a producer. I'll try to do better.  [To Jack Nicholson on stage:] You can't hear me? Let me tell you this... alright.  Okay, now, to those of you who may have heard rumor here or there of my life in Hollywood as a single man. The poet wrote, 'Only solitary men know the true joy of friendship. Others have their family, but to a solitary man his friends are everything.' So I want to thank you, my friends, for leading me through those days, and finally, in fact, leading me to Annette. Please forgive me for making her unavailable to your movies four times -- that's four times. I would like to say I'll try to do better, but you and I know that I won't. So, let's just say that I'll try to do less. Yes, I'll try to do less. She is my treasure. She has given me what I value most, her love. And she's given me Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel and at the moment, this much anticipated and very loved unnamed being, who could actually join us any minute right here in the second row if I don't wrap this up.  So, I cannot imagine a public circumstance in which so many affirmations of work and life that could converge at one time. Let me put it another way -- as a screenwriter, I'd never sit still for it. You know, you can't have the husband up here getting this thing and the wife down there maybe getting that thing, and she's having a baby at the same time. It doesn't work, you have to throw it out, you have to pick one, they'll never believe it. So, I would say to you, don't worry, I don't ever expect another evening like this to be so full. But there are some things that really aren't going to change. They don't have to change, and please listen to me on this, Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel, I know you're not in bed. The things that don't have to change for us are our reliability of friendship, the sanctity of our family, and the dignity of our work. Thank you very much from way down here."

Kevin Spacey, you do indeed rule. Annette, you are astounding. Wes, Thora, Mena, Chris, Allison, Peter, Sam and Scott, you brought these characters to life with depths and shadings I never even thought of. Everybody at DreamWorks, for taking a chance on a bunch of first timers, for letting us make the movie and for marketing it so brilliantly. My agent Andrew Cannava. My family, especially my mom. All the writers I have ever worked with, for everything that they taught me.

My fervent hope is that the only flames people will encounter will be the great passions of the heart -- love, gratitude and solidarity."

DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form. To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world. To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell. But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott. You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable. But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible. Thanks very much."

So I thank you for really making me feel so... [laughs!] I love it up here! Yeah, anyway, I start working for him again in two days, so I can get to you later. But Benjamin Bratt, my sister Lisa, my brother-in-law Tony. Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who's been my agent since God was a boy. Jeff Berg. My mom! And just Frances* and Marcus and Mike and everybody who's watching at home. Kelly, Emma, everybody. I love the world! I'm so happy! Thank you!"

But instead I hope you will accept our thanks for not messing it up. David Franzoni, great dreaming.

Ridley Scott, you invaded three continents with your tireless perfectionism and brought new meaning to the phrase, 'mad dogs and Engishman in the noonday sun.' Bill Nicholson and John Logan, you saved our flank. Russell Crowe, you filled a whole arena with the force of your face and put the human back in the hero. Stacey Snider, Ronnie Meyer, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, Terry Press, in those early days where it looked like all roads might lead not to Rome but to ruin, you were gladiators. Sarah, Julia, Tessa, Lucy, for me, all roads lead to you.  DAVID FRANZONI: Thanking all the same people Doug thanked -- but that gentleman genius, Ridley Scott, who transported us back thousands of years in time so effortlessly and beautifully, thank you Ridley. Russell, Joaquin, everyone, thank you so much. My wife Nancye, my son Hudson, my dearly departed dad, who was the greatest storyteller who ever lived.

I accept this rarest of honors on behalf of all screenwriters everywhere, but especially those in the Writers Guild of America. We have suffered anonymity far too often. I appeal to all movie critics and feature writers to please always bear in mind that a film production begins and ends with a screenplay. However, this glorious night is demonstrating that film belongs to many: to the creators of original works, to superbly talented actors, directors, producers, and to gifted collaborators. Had it not been for all of them, I certainly would not be up here having one of the most exciting nights in a long lifetime.

And this I want to say something to the big studio[s]: Don't be afraid about young talent. New mind[s], young mind[s] are the future of tomorrow['s] films.

And if we are doing documentaries, that [is] because we do believe that as storyteller[s] we can help dreams come true.  DENIS PONCET: Just one thing because I know that time is up. This film was supposed to stay in Europe and thanks to somebody called Christine Le Goff it came to the United States.

This is one of the rare moments where we as editors get to share a corner of the limelight with the stars and editors -- and directors, I'm sorry -- and it feels great. Editors are like alchemists; we play with magic and we are privileged to witness small miracles of creation when we combine the talents and contributions from everyone involved in the process of making movies. I wouldn't be standing up here if it weren't for the generosity and trust of Ridley Scott. I would like to share this award with my crew and everyone that has contributed to the success of 'Black Hawk Down.' Special thanks to the Moroccan people of Rabat and Sale for their hard work and hospitality. Maya, Julian and Teresa, you bless my life, I love you. And thank you very much. Viva Italia!"

I had an unbelievably caring mother and father who lived their lives with the moral values of love and compassion, of respect and responsibility, of human dignity and standing up for what's right. Even though they had a hard time earning a living they helped the poor and the hungry and they also helped others who needed the support of a friend or someone to stand up for their rights. They felt all other people as individual human beings and judged them by their actions, not by their color or their race or their religion.  I wish I could say that I'm as strong as they were in all those areas, but I'm so grateful to them for instilling these values in my loving sisters and me. And I'm so grateful to my loving wife and our wonderful children. My wife's so supportive. And Henryk and Erica just can't be better. Gwen and the kids are always behind me and sometimes pushing me to live up to those values. It's so embarrassing to receive an award for doing what you should be doing, but I must admit it pleases me greatly. And it especially honors me to receive it from this Academy that I respect so deeply and that has always meant so much to me personally. Thank you."

        "speech": "SIDNEY POITIER: I arrived in Hollywood at the age of twenty-two in a time different than today's, a time in which the odds against my standing here tonight fifty-three years later would not have fallen in my favor. Back then, no route had been established for where I was hoping to go, no pathway left in evidence for me to trace, no custom for me to follow.  Yet, here I am this evening at the end of a journey that in 1949 would have been considered almost impossible and in fact might never have been set in motion were there not an untold number of courageous, unselfish choices made by a handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers; each with a strong sense of citizenship responsibility to the times in which they lived; each unafraid to permit their art to reflect their views and values, ethical and moral, and moreover, acknowledge them as their own. They knew the odds that stood against them and their efforts were overwhelming and likely could have proven too high to overcome. Still those filmmakers persevered, speaking through their art to the best in all of us. And I've benefited from their effort. The industry benefited from their effort. America benefited from their effort. And in ways large and small the world has also benefited from their effort.  Therefore, with respect, I share this great honor with the late Joe Mankiewicz, the late Richard Brooks, the late Ralph Nelson, the late Darryl Zanuck, the late Stanley Kramer, the Mirisch brothers, especially Walter whose friendship lies at the very heart of this moment, Guy Green, Norman Jewison, and all others who have had a hand in altering the odds for me and for others. Without them this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have. I accept this award in memory of all the African-American actors and actresses who went before me in the difficult years, on whose shoulders I was privileged to stand to see where I might go.  My love and my thanks to my wonderful, wonderful wife, my children, my grandchildren, my agent and friend Martin Baum. And finally, to those audience members around the world who have placed their trust in my judgment as an actor and filmmaker, I thank each of you for your support through the years. Thank you."

It's a funny kind of business to be shy in, but [I] certainly feel that way tonight. But I think there certainly is a word of appreciation in order for being honored in such a way. You know, much of what happens here tonight is probably going to be forgotten in a week or so. But what's not going to be forgotten is what it means to those of us who are receiving awards or being honored tonight, and to those close to us. For those people, it can be the moment of a lifetime. So in my appreciation, I'd like to say what it means for me.  I've spent most of my life just focused on the road ahead, not looking back. But now tonight, I'm seeing in the rear view mirror that there is something I've not thought about much, called history. And what moves me tonight is that I'm being joined by colleagues and peers to reflect on that history. There really are only two areas. One is my personal work, which is the most important to me. And the other is trying to put something back into an industry that's been good to me. And of course Sundance is a manifestation of that. And the result, well, a grand, grand collaboration of artists and colleagues who have joined to support and help give a voice to new artists. To those people who have supported us along the way, who have believed and participated, tonight I would really like to thank you deeply.  We have a great industry and we all know that. We're here because we know it, we love it. It's a solid and healthy industry. But even though it is, I really believe it's going to be important in the years to come to make sure that we embrace the risks as well as the sure things, to make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive, because I believe that in keeping diversity alive it will help keep our industry alive. As we can see of late the world around us is in a sea change. It's just simply not the same world anymore. As we all struggle to find our way with it, to get a grip, to make sense out of the chaos and the destruction and the tragedy, one word that emerges is the word 'freedom'...its importance, its rarity and how fortunate we are to have it. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly. And I think the glory of art is that it can not only survive change, it can lead it. As an artist I just can't think of a better life than the one that I've been blessed with. It's just a great ride with many wonderful relationships and experiences along the way, and it's a ride I hope to continue.  So tonight, I want to acknowledge my family, my love for them, my lady, the Academy and all of you for giving me this honor. Thank you."

I started out in the business as a writer -- not a very good writer -- but a writer, nonetheless. I've had the privilege of working with better writers, great actors and brilliant directors. I found that my calling was to tell stories as a producer and I love doing just that. In the case of 'A Beautiful Mind' the story and the subject were personal and important to me, and to receive an award for making this movie is a miracle.  I want to thank Universal Pictures, two very important and special people to me, Ron Meyer and Stacey Snider. I want to thank their team including Scott, Peter, Marc and Nikki. DreamWorks, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. I want to thank Sylvia Nasar and Graydon Carter. And my dedicated team at Imagine, Michael Rosenberg, Maureen Peyrot, Todd Hallowell and especially Karen Kehela, who is an amazing partner to me for her enormous contributions. Ron Howard, a closer friend, a better partner, a more inspired and evolving filmmaker I could never find. Thank you, Ron, for all of that.  I can't pull this apart [referring to his notes]. I'm so nervous. I know it's imperceptible.  It's my honor to work with the profound Russell Crowe. And we wouldn't be here if it weren't for Russell Crowe. His amazing dedication, work ethic and artistry have gotten us here. The sublime Jennifer Connelly and all the fine actors on the movie. Akiva Goldsman, thank you for creating this difficult and heartrending script. And thank you James Horner for your most original and haunting score. Thank you to John and Alicia Nash. You've not only inspired a movie that has given so many a greater understanding of the vagaries of the mind, but you've given us a greater understanding of ourselves. I hope in some way our movie helped to improve the way we feel about and treat the mentally ill.  And then I want to thank my little circle of love.

I haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win. But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times.

And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.  I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement. And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.  What can I say? This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. And this is a tribute to his survival. I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime. And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually. I would not be here without all their efforts. And I thank them. And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film. And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there. To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna. Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH. And you know...[music plays]. Wait one second. One second, please, one second. Cut it out, cut it out. I get one shot at this. I'm sorry. I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...  This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war. And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you. And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution. Thank you. And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski. And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon. God bless you, guys. I love you. Thank you very much."

In this movie I play a victim of abuse and violence, and if you are out there and are a person that has had that tragedy befall you, there is no shame and no weakness in seeking help and counseling. It is sometimes the strongest thing that you can do to stop the cycle of violence. Thank you."

The first person that came to mind when I tried to pick them out was a little guy who worked on the film I did called 'The Party.' And he used to come out with a shovel and scoop up the elephant poop. And as he did he sang 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' And then there was a confused Italian actor that we tried to get him to understand what this okay sign [makes 'okay' hand sign] meant in our vernacular. Okay. We just said, just do that [makes 'okay' hand sign]. And he always did this [makes wrong hand sign]. And so we decided better we conform to him than he to us. So from then on, on the set, I would say, get the shot, Phil? [Makes wrong hand sign]. Cutting room: you drop a couple frames just before the alligator swallows the chimp, Ralphie? [Makes wrong hand sign]. Do you think Audrey can sing it, Henry? [Makes wrong hand sign]. The point is, each and every one who has contributed to this moment, friends and foes alike--yeah, I couldn't have done it without the foes. I'm steamed and I'm gonna prove you're wrong, okay? So it's everyone, from the little guy with the shovel to the discerning folks in the Academy. My mother thanks you. My father thanks you.

Thank you so much, Barrie, for just being there every day and supporting us. To a wonderful cast, a wonderful crew in New Zealand, everybody that made my working days so enjoyable. It was just there when I needed it to be there and the actors were just doing such a wonderful job. I just want to thank two very special people that when I was eight years old I made films at home on a Super-8 camera that my mum and dad had bought for me.

I'm so honored, touched and relieved that the Academy and the members of the Academy that have supported us have seen past the trolls and the wizards and the hobbits and are recognizing fantasy this year. Fantasy is an F-word that hopefully the five second delay won't do anything with. I just want to say a very few quick words especially to the people of New Zealand and the government of New Zealand and the city councils and everybody who supported us the length and breadth of the country--Billy Crystal is welcome to come and make a film in New Zealand any time he wants. A special thanks to Peter Nelson and Ken Kamins, who were with me right from the days of 'Bad Taste' and 'Meet the Feebles,' which were wisely overlooked by the Academy at that time. And I especially want to pay tribute to our wonderful producer Barrie Osborne. And I'd please like him to say a few words.  BARRIE M. OSBORNE: It's a great honor to be here. I started out in the business thirty-five years ago getting people coffee. And I wonder if the fact that I dated Billy Crystal's cousin so many years ago has anything to do with this. But it is really a great pleasure to be in such great company--uh-oh, I'm in trouble now--to be nominated with these four other great films, and after these many years to receive this award is really a thrill for all of us and we all thank the Academy. It's really a tribute to the talents of all the people, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, that we win this award. I want to thank in particular my partner Carol, my beautiful daughter Danielle, and my eighty-seven-year-old dad who's out there in the back somewhere here to celebrate this with us. I want to thank also J.R.R. Tolkien, and also the fans that supported us on this journey. And of course Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, whose courageous venture allowed us to make this film and their support throughout the journey. And Mark Ordesky, who worked alongside of us throughout and became a great friend. And of course to Peter Jackson, who was never satisfied with 100 percent, but by his example of pushing for 110 percent, he inspired all of us to do our utmost to make these films and bring them to the screen. And finally, to Weta, who is in Chicago [Sports Café] in Wellington, New Zealand, and to the production team, who are in the Port Nicholson Yacht Club--it's time to celebrate."

And I was lucky enough to be nominated on the first movie, so I started to fantasize about the speech. And I was a real smart aleck, and I thought I would say something like, 'I don't want to thank anybody; I did it alone.' It wasn't true, but I thought it would be a way of getting a little attention.  When Frank Pierson called me about receiving this one, of course I started thinking about the speech again. And I realized that if I totaled up all of the 'thank yous' that I've heard in all of these years, I wouldn't be able to thank all the people that I really want to. I'm not just talking about the glorious talents that I've worked with on both sides of the camera, but there are so many with whom I've never even worked that I owe so much. I mean, how do I thank Spielberg and Scorsese and Coppola? How do I thank Jean Vigo, and Carl Dreyer, and Willy Wyler, and Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton? And I'm not mentioning the ones that I really stole from. What about the Epsteins for writing a line like, 'Here's lookin' at you, kid?' Or Wilder and Diamond for, 'Well, nobody's perfect.' Or Faragoh for, 'Mother of God, is this the end of Rico?'  So, what I guess it comes down to is I'd like to thank the movies. I know that sounds general, but it's very real to me. I've got the best job in the best profession in the world, so I just want to thank all of it.  And of course, the ones who've paid more dues than I have: Thank you Piedy, Amy, Jenny. See you later."

Marc Forster, he should be here. Marc, thank you for your subtle mind, for your incredible talent. Also Richard is here, Richard Gladstein, a man who truly understands the power of music. I'm very thankful for this as well. And then my wife Elzbieta, who always surprises me with her intellectual passion and incredible taste. She's responsible for many good notes I've written. And to my friend and agent Anita Greenspan, thank you so much.  Who is left? Many people. But I'm too overwhelmed to really go on. I should certainly take opportunity to, as the first person in the room, to thank Harvey Weinstein for his support. And very thankful as well for supporting 'Finding Neverland' and my case. Musicians [are] usually forgotten, but [they are] extraordinary people who made music alive, and without them the best music just doesn't exist. So, thank you very much. My collaborators in Poland and here in America--Krzysztof, Rafal, Leszek--thank you so much. I'm very, very honored."

If you're watching this on TV, don't try that at home. He directs, I produce. I want to first start off by thanking HBO, for their knowledge of documentaries for fifteen, twenty years has really brought it to the forefront now.

As many of you know, Marty's Film Foundation has been a leader in the film preservation movement, just as Jean Hersholt was a leader in the Motion Picture & Television Fund. And interestingly enough, he contributed the land on which our hospital, retirement community and Alzheimer's unit were built. So, there's a real connection there.  As for film preservation, I must give credit to the six board chairmen [and] seven production heads during my twenty-five years at MGM who either backed our endeavors or weren't quite sure what we were doing so let it happen anyway. And then came Ted Turner and his cohorts in Atlanta, who understood the importance of all this and kept it going when funds were pretty short. Preservation and restoration are now led by the studios and organizations nationwide such as The Museum of Modern Art and Eastman House in New York, UCLA and our own Academy Archives here in Los Angeles, and most particularly, the Library of Congress. And as I thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this great honor, I want to remind all of you that the Academy itself, namely you, support film preservation and health care through both the Motion Picture & Television Fund and the National Film Preservation Foundation. So, we sincerely thank you.  And of course, most importantly, thanks to my family, all of whom are here tonight. My children Patty and Larry, daughter-in-law Jennifer, sister Florence, granddaughters Natasha and Anna. And most especially, my wife of fifty-two-and-a-half years, Pauline. Fifty-two-and-a-half years; and they say nothing lasts in Hollywood? Well, love really does, 'Taking Care of Our Own' does, and the art of film does if we properly preserve it. So I'm going to keep at it and hope you will continue your support. Thank you very, very much."

I want to talk to you later. Both of you. Because Oprah allowed me to meet somebody by the name of Sidney Poitier. And Sidney Poitier said [mimicking his voice], 'I saw you once. And I looked in your eyes and there was a connection.' And he says, 'I give to you responsibility.' So I'm taking that responsibility tonight. And thank you, Sidney.

And this is going to be the toughest part. But she was my first acting teacher. She told me, 'Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back. Act like you got some sense.' We would go places and I would wild out, and she says, 'Act like you've been somewhere.' And then when I would act the fool, she would beat me. She would whup me. And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it. And after she whipped me, she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me, said, 'I want you to be a southern gentleman.' And she still talks to me now; only now she talks to me in my dreams.

And finally, I would say that, you know, we are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood every once in a while, I think. It's probably a good thing.

And she's a real woman and I really appreciate that. It was an incredible gift that you gave me, so thank you. And T Bone Burnett for helping me realize my lifelong dream of being a country music singer; thank you, T Bone.

My mother and my father are here. And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me.

I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children—who should be going to bed—and thank you for loving me so much and supporting me. And I want to say that my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life. She taught me how to be a real woman, to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away. And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter. And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: 'I'm just trying to matter.' And I know what she means.

Their names are 'Ennis' and 'Jack' and they taught all of us who made 'Brokeback Mountain' so much about, not just all the gay men and women whose love is denied by society, but just as important, the greatness of love itself. Thank you. Thank you, members of the Academy, for this tremendous honor. And to everyone at Focus Features, in particular David Linde, James Schamus, thank you for your love and support. To Bill Pohlad, Tory Metzger, Ira Schreck, Joe Dapello, many thanks. And a special thanks to David Lee. And thanks to my wife Jane Lin and my boys Han and Mason. I love you. On 'Brokeback' I felt you with me every day. I just did this movie after my father passed away; more than any other, I made this for him.

I was really honored and moved to accept this award. When the news first came to me about it, I was caught kind of off guard. I always thought this type of award meant that it was over. And then it dawned on me that I was busy in rehearsals on a play that I'm doing in London right now. It opened last night, Arthur Miller's last play, 'Resurrection Blues.' I was doing an interview for my new film that I just finished, 'A Prairie Home Companion,' which will come out in the summer. And I realized that it's not over. Of course I was happy and thrilled, and thrilled to accept this award. And I look at it as a nod to all of my films because, to me, I've just made one long film. And I know some of you have liked some of the sections, and others you.... Anyway, it's alright.  And I want to thank all of the people that have worked on all my pictures so hard, the brilliant actors, the amazing crews. And I can't name them all so I'm going to name a doctor who is taking care of me, Jody Kaplan*. So she represents everybody who have supported me and made it possible.  I've always said that making a film is like making a sandcastle at the beach. You invite your friends and you get them down there and you build this beautiful structure, several of you, and then you sit back and watch the tide come in. Have a drink, watch the tide come in and the ocean just takes it away. And that sandcastle remains in your mind. Now I've built about forty of them, and I never tire of it. No other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have. I'm very fortunate in my career. I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop. I love filmmaking. It has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition and for that I'm forever grateful.  Finally I'd like to thank my family—you're all up there, all of them, almost—for their love and support through the years. And most importantly, I want to thank and applaud my wife Kathryn Reed Altman, without whom I wouldn't be here today. I love you, Trixie. Thank you.  Oh, one more thing. I'm here, I think, under kind of false pretenses, and I think I have to become straight with you. Ten years ago, eleven years ago, I had a heart transplant. A total heart transplant. I got the heart of, I think, a young woman who was about in her late thirties, and so by that kind of calculation, you may be giving me this award too early. Because I think I've got about forty years left on it. And I intend to use it. Thank you very much. Thank you."

When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies. So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen. Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us. Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.  So I want to thank my fellow believers in 'The Last King of Scotland.' I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four. I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit.

Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of 'Little Miss Sunshine' for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.  I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support. My representation: Estelle, Lee, Frank and Melody. And for the great teachers I've had throughout my life, both in and out of the profession. Thank you very much."

And on another note, I know a lot of people in America are probably watching and asking, 'What are the short films?' Well, a lot of them are made by directors who are trying to get noticed, and I think in a lot of ways we represent the little guy because we don't have big studios behind us or big name actors or a lot of times the budgets we need, and it relies on perseverance and stick-to-itiveness and hustle and a dedication and a loyalty from a cast and crew who are doing it for pennies if not for nothing.

Anyway, I was going to cut off the beginning of this speech and make it brief, but I'm gonna leave it back in and say the movie that made me wanna be a screenwriter was Robert Bolt's 'Lawrence of Arabia.' And I don't know what could've happened in the universe to end up at the same Oscars as Peter O'Toole, you know; so it's crazy. He's here, I've seen him.  So anyway, thanks to the Academy, to Warner Bros., everybody at Warner Bros. Alan Mak and Felix Chong who wrote 'Infernal Affairs.' The producers present and not present, the agents, everybody who made 'The Departed' such a success. Thanks to Marty and Leo for reading the script and calling each other and saying let's make it. And Thelma. Everyone who worked on 'The Departed' was, it's easy to say, on the top of their game before they started, and under Marty's direction it only got higher after that. Thank you very much."

And finally, when I was a kid my family drove 600 miles in a VW bus with a broken clutch. So, it ended up being the funnest things we did together. So, to my brothers Chan, Dave and Chris, to my mom who's here tonight, and to my dad who's with us in spirit, this is for you. Thank you."

He says this Oscar is not a point of arrival but a starting point to continue writing with the same passion and dedication he's had since the very beginning on the screen.

That is really what is so wonderful about the movie industry, not only do we get to make films that matter, but we also work in a culture where we are encouraged to speak out. We may not always agree, but we do always care.  Through my work I have met scientists who struggle every day to find cures for diseases. They do so quietly, without glamour or attention, but always with passion and conviction. I have met school teachers who are battling against insurmountable odds, and yet they never stop trying to reach our children. To me they are the real heroes, and tonight I share this honor with all of them.  On a personal note, I want to thank my husband Billy and our two boys, Cedric and Jack, whose unconditional love gives me the courage to fight every day for what I believe in. And a special thank you to the members of the Academy for this extraordinary honor. I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to live up to it. Thank you so much. Thank you."

I also would like to thank my children and grandchildren who supported me with their love and support, thank them.  And to Norman Jewison who made moviemaking fun and much laughter while dealing with real subjects. And to Don Siegel, who cut to the chase and gave us truth. And with all of these there was my beginning at the USC School of Architecture and my great colleagues in the Art Directors Guild who supported me. And finally, to Jean Firstenberg who introduced me to the American Film Institute and the opportunity to give back to the next generation of storytellers.  Since I've been around here for almost a century, I've noted a lot of conflicts, but there was one bright image in this whole life of ours, and that was the arts, and particularly the art of the moviemakers, of the moving image that we all love.

I'm very grateful to my good friends for supporting me through lots of things through these years, and my family, who I love very much, my girls. And my father and my mother, thank you for passing on a very deep and strong love of music. Thank you."

Thank you, Woody, for trusting me with this beautiful character. Thank you for having written over all these years some of the greatest characters for women. And I cannot talk about great female characters without thanking my friend Pedro Almodóvar for having made me part of so many of his adventures. Thank you, Bigas Luna, Fernando Trueba, for giving me my first two movies. Thank you, Harvey Weinstein. I want to dedicate this to my parents and to my brother and sister, to my friend Robert Garlock, who is not with us anymore, and to everyone who has helped me from the beginning, and you know who you are, and I thank you from my heart.  I grew up in a place called Alcobendas, where this was not a very realistic dream. And I, always the night of the Academy Awards I stay up to watch the show. And I always felt that this was, that this ceremony was a moment of unity for the world, because art, in any form, is and has been and will always be our universal language and we should do everything we can, everything we can to protect its survival.

When I was thirteen years old, my beautiful mother and my father moved me from a conservative Mormon home in San Antonio, Texas, to California, and I heard the story of Harvey Milk. And it gave me hope. It gave me the hope to live my life. It gave me the hope one day I could live my life openly as who I am and that maybe even I could even fall in love and one day get married. I wanna, I wanna thank my mom, who has always loved me for who I am even when there was pressure not to. But most of all, if Harvey had not been taken from us thirty years ago, I think he'd want me to say to all of the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight who have been told that they are less than by their churches or by the government or by their families, that you are beautiful, wonderful creatures of value and that no matter what anyone tells you God does love you, and that very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours.

The same magic that happens in our film happens every day for children with clefts all around the world because of a terrific organization called The Smile Train. But most importantly for documentary filmmakers it's our subjects: the incredible Dr. Subodh and his team, Ghutaru Chauhan, and our heroine Pinki Kumari. Thank you, thank you, thank you for letting me tell your inspiring story. What a gift. Thank you all so much."

We've mentioned a lot of people, I forgot a guy, the guy who choreographed the dance at the end of the film. He's called Longiness, and I forgot him off the credits. And I only found out about it two weeks ago. I'm an idiot and I apologize from the bottom of my heart, Longiness. Thank you so much.  Finally, just to say to Mumbai: Unending, inseparable, unborn.

Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks. And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room. And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.  And finally, for those--two last finallies. For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support. We've got to have equal rights for everyone. And there are, and there are these last two things. I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother.

But what we had was a script that inspired mad love in everyone who read it. We had a genius for a director. We had a cast and a crew who were unwavering in their commitment and whose talents are up on the screen for all of you to see. We had partners in Film4, in Celador, in Pathé and Fox Searchlight who had the courage to support us. And we had a shared love for the extraordinary city of Mumbai where we made the movie. Most of all we had passion and we had belief. And our film shows that if you have those two things, truly anything is possible. I want to thank, on a personal note, my mum and my dad for all their love and support over the years. I want to thank my girl, Saskia Mulder, who is my partner in crime and the light in my life.

This was something I never expected. I was in total shock when I got the call, and the shock has not quite worn off, I have to say.  I've been very lucky in my life, probably luckier than I deserve. But to, at the age of nineteen, have been chosen by Howard Hawks to work in a film with a man named Humphrey Bogart, didn't thrill me too much when I heard it. I thought, Bogart, God...dese dem and dose guys, can't, you know... I thought that was not for me. He had said, 'Maybe Cary Grant.' I said, 'Well! Now you're talking.' But it ended up being Bogart; that was my great luck. Because he was not only a wonderful actor, but he was an extraordinary man. And he gave me a life and he changed my life. And he told me about all the ins and outs and ups and downs, of which there were many. And not so many downs with him. And from then on, I must say, for as many years as, I cannot believe sixty years, but it has been that long. [Laughs.] It's amazing, isn't it? Considering how young I am. Anyway. Miracles will never cease.  The fact is that I've had the great good fortune of not only being shown the way by Bogie, and having two wonderful children who are right here, Steve and Leslie, right here with me, but in also being able to work with some of the best leading men in this business. And have forged the greatest friendships with Greg Peck, who I miss very much and love very dearly. And his wife got in the way, but what are you gonna do? [Laughs.] And anyway. Veronique, hello! [Laughs.]  Anyway, I really was lucky. I really did work with, with Kirk – and he said, 'Never fear,' he said to me backstage, 'Never fear, Kirk is here.' Confidence is a great thing, isn't it? But Kirk, and Duke Wayne, surprisingly had a marvelous relationship with him for two movies. And Greg. It's quite amazing the people that I've worked with. I've worked with Hank Fonda and met – unfortunately not really Jimmy Stewart, but some of the all-time all-time greats. And was directed by not only Howard Hawks, who was a marvelous director, a great movie director, but John Huston, of course, who was the great director and who showed me the way, and tripped me a few times en route. But he was a jokester, and because – and he loved to laugh, and he had an incredible laugh so one could hardly blame him.  But anyway, not to tell you the entire story of my life, I just must say that I have to thank the Academy and I'm very grateful that they think I'm deserving of this honor. And as I repeat, I certainly did not expect to receive it, but I do welcome it. And the thought when I get home that I'm gonna have a two-legged man in my room is so exciting I can hardly stand it. So I would like to thank all of you, and I thank them. And, what else can I say? It's what I feel, and I feel very emotional and I feel very grateful, and not least of all that I'm still alive. I mean after all, some of you are surprised, aren't you? Nevertheless I am, and I'm here to stay. You better get used to the idea. Thank you very much."

We all work in what I think is the only true modern art form. All other arts had their origins in antiquity and are therefore, to a certain extent, static. Motion pictures encompass movement, which is one of the key characteristics of our day, and for that reason they are modern. There's another reason as well. And the reason is that traditional art has been done, let us say, by composers, writers, poets, painters, who could create their art individually. Motion pictures require, the filmmaker requires a cast and a crew, and they must be paid. As a result our art is somewhat compromised. We're compromised between art and business and I think that represents something of the compromised world in which we live.  I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances. Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded. Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble. But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make. It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films. But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble. So I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances. Thank you."

I've done a lot of things in this business, but I've never worked for Roger Corman. And after I thought about it, it's the best thing that ever happened to him. I can't see too well anymore, unfortunately [pulling out his notes]; I made my own little thing up here.  My life in this business has been a series of, sort of great encounters, and they have been an embarrassment of riches as they say. I've always had an opportunity to do what I want, and the way I want, and I've always worked with the people that have given me that opportunity. In retrospect, I think probably every good thing that's ever happened to me happened because of another person. And fifty-four years ago, I met this darling girl and married her, had three kids, now five grandchildren, and along the way I met this remarkable group of directors, producers, very fine actors, and very fine technicians who extended themselves for me. And I can never really give them back what they gave to me; I had the best of it.  To the Academy, thank you very much. I really appreciate this. And a remark on a lighter vein. All the beautiful women that I worked with in this business that were terrified of looking like Marlon Brando; it's okay, it's over now. You're safe.

And then I was introduced to Quentin Tarantino who was putting together an expedition that was equipped by Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender and David Linde. And he put this script in front of me and he said, 'This is where we're going, but we're going the other way.' So Brad Pitt helped me on board and Diane Kruger was there.

And Quentin, with his unorthodox methods of navigation, this fearless explorer took this ship across and brought it in with flying colors. And that's why I'm here. And this is your welcoming embrace, and there's no way I can ever thank you enough. But I can start right now: Thank you."

Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with. Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite. You are beyond words to me. Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick. Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you. And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.  I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know. To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family. I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different: John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you. To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago. I'm still holding a grudge.  But there's so many people to thank; not enough time. So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from. Those moms and parents never get thanked. I, in particular, failed to thank one. So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do. For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be. She said to be an artist you had to practice every day. And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else. We are all deserving of love. So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.

First of all, this is so extraordinary to be in the company of such powerful, my fellow nominees, such powerful filmmakers who have inspired me and I have admired for, some of whom, for decades. And thank you to every member of the Academy. This is, again, the moment of a lifetime.  I would not be standing here if it wasn't for Mark Boal, who risked his life for the words on the page and wrote such a courageous screenplay. That I was fortunate enough to have an extraordinary cast bring that screenplay to life in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. And, I think the secret to directing is collaborating and I had truly an extraordinary group of collaborators in my crew: Barry Ackroyd, and Kalle Júlíusson, and Bob Murawski, Chris Innis, Ray Beckett, Richard Stutsman. And if I could just also thank my producing partners in Greg Shapiro and Nick Chartier, and my wonderful agent Brian Siberell. And the people of Jordan, who were such a... so hospitable to us when we were shooting.  And I'd just like to dedicate this to the women and men in the military who risk their lives on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. And may they come home safe. Thank you."

And, you know, we had this fantasy of making our film our way with the talent that we hoped to have, and hopefully we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie. So to be standing here, this was really, truly, honestly never part of anything we even imagined in our wildest dreams. So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined.  GREG SHAPIRO: Thank you to the Academy. This is really unreal and extremely humbling. We also have to thank our intrepid financier and fellow producer, Nicolas Chartier, who bet on this movie when no one else would. The incredible support that we got from CAA, particularly Joel Lubin, Roeg Sutherland, Brian Siberell. Our entire cast and crew, and our fearless director.  MARK BOAL: Our fearless director. And also, we owe a deep debt of gratitude, by the way, to Summit Entertainment and Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger for distributing this film. And thank you, Mom. I forgot to thank you before.  KATHRYN BIGELOW: I was just gonna reiterate that with Rob and Patrick, who took a very brave shot with this movie, and we owe them dearly. And perhaps one more dedication: To men and women all over the world who, sorry to reiterate, but wear a uniform. But even not just the military – hazmat, emergency, firemen. You know, they're there for us and we're there for them. Thank you. Thank you."

        "speech": "KEVIN BROWNLOW: If you've ever wondered what reflected glory looks like, this is it. On behalf of all those film historians, film preservationists, and film collectors... I hear an intake of breath. Not so long ago film collectors were endangered in this town by a knock on the door from the FBI. I hope you have learnt that we were not your enemies. But my god, your predecessors did a terrible job of preserving the silent era. Historian David Pierce is about to reveal 73 percent has been destroyed. Now, that's like a publisher taking Tolstoy, Dickens, Scott Fitzgerald, despulping every copy, and you can't even see the manuscript because they've burnt that as well. So it's up to us to do our damnedest to find the films that your predecessors destroyed and bring them back into the canon. An awful lot is being done as you know – the recent find in New Zealand, the recent generosity from Russia – but when I think of some of the titles that are gone it's really heartbreaking.  Now, I was told when I started this business that silent films were a complete waste of time. They were jerky, flickery, ludicrously badly acted and appallingly photographed. And I couldn't understand it because I was already a film collector and what I saw in beautiful prints, although sometimes abridged, were... I was struck by the freshness, the vitality, the innovation and the exquisite photography. Ah, and I really do regret the loss of black and white. It was a beautiful medium. It called upon you to do some work, like silent film itself you have to supply the voices and sound effects, and with black and white you supply everything that the film suggested and therefore you become part of the creative process and it means that much more.  Now, film is a collaborative medium and I took it to its extremes. I think I've worked on practically everything with a partner. My wife, of course, of forty-one years. She is wearing tonight jewelry given her by Alice Terry. Match that! Then there are my partners: Andrew Mollo, twelve years; David Gill, twenty-three years, alas he died in '97; and I'd better not leave out my current producer, Patrick Stanbury; and Christopher Bird, the most recent co-director.  I've had a very fortunate life as you can guess. And to give you an example: I was very impressed by the feature comedies of Harold Lloyd. He seemed... If I wanted to convert someone to silent films I just ran them a Lloyd picture. That's all you had to do. But you could not get hold of them. He kept such close grasp that we were reduced to two for a long time, and I knew the fellow who had those two but he wouldn't even consider exchanging or selling them. Well, I wrote a fan letter to Harold Lloyd, and I was very disappointed. He didn't answer. Celebrities don't, you know. And I was dozing one Sunday morning and I imagined that I had at last gone to Hollywood, and I was being shown around the Motion Picture Home by D.W. Griffith himself. And he said, 'Over there is a room with a great cameraman. Over there lives a very fine editor.' And at the end of the corridor the telephone rang. And in my head I started tracking forward, as one does, and I dissolved through and my telephone was ringing. So I went out into the hall and picked it up and a voice said, 'Kevin, you'll never guess who this is. It's Harold Lloyd.' He invited me to the Dorchester Hotel, and then began a long and extremely fruitful friendship. I loved him! Actually, he was so charming he should have been the original of Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People.'  And I became fascinated by what these people did. They were the most extraordinary people I've ever met in my life, when I finally got to America and met them en masse. It was not just the stars, but the cameramen, the art directors and even the title writers. I remember one of them, Monty Brice, told me that his first title writing job he was literally taken off the golf course. Somebody had fallen ill; none of the title writers were getting anywhere near a good joke. And so he came in in his rather loud knickerbockers, and these tough ex-newspapermen all looked at him and said, 'That's your title writing outfit, huh?' And he said... he had no idea. What he had to produce was a title which suggested that Al St. John had left for the city, had failed in everything he'd done and was returning. He said to me, 'God send me a flash. I said, 'How 'bout this boys: Al left home to set the world on fire but had to come back for more matches.''  Now, it is amazing what's turning up, and if you would only relax your copyright laws where silent films are concerned you would see an awful lot more suddenly appear. That has been one of the worst chains on this whole affair of ours to try and rescue the past of the cinema. And I'll just tell you one terrible story which sums it all up. And I've got the film that – well, I shouldn't admit this because it's probably copyright – but I have the film in which this appears. Junior Laemmle was in charge of the Collegians series at Universal. And there's a sporting event, a swimming event, which one college wins and they build bonfires and they come home and have a wild party, or come back to the college and have the wild party, setting the bonfires alight. But it doesn't burn, they don't burn strongly enough. And Junior Laemmle says, 'Pile on the silent negatives; we'll never need them again.' And on that note, that cautionary tale, they burnt beautifully. I'll leave you. Thank you."

As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters, and mafiosi than you could shake a stick at. As a civilian I collect antique clocks, tell endless stories of my days as a medic in World War II, watch every tennis match, live for my family [and] daily mail, run the dishwasher, take pictures of faces in the bark of trees. I really have a penchant for a man named Josh Brolin. [Pointing:] There he is.  Speaking of mail, sometimes I receive the most bizarre correspondence, ranging from an Englishman looking for help funding his mother's latest heart operation, to last year's letter from the Pope – really – gushing up to me for his favorite film was 'The Magnificent Seven.' I couldn't understand that, I kept killing people in there. And why not drop by for a visit the next time I'm in Rome. I didn't realize I had friends in such high places. I didn't even know I was joining the Academy for chrissake! On a more serious note, I'm deeply moved by this honor. Your recognition of my artistry makes something very [cl]ear to me: I don't act to live. I live to act.  I have one last story to tell. Two young men were planning a gift for their elderly father's birthday so they decided to hire and send over a hooker. During negotiations she asks, 'How old is the birthday boy?' 'Oh, he's in his nineties.' 'Oh, easy,' she said, 'I can handle him easy.' So she goes over to the old man's house, knocks on his door. The old man opens it and says, 'Yes, what is it?' So she smiles and says, 'I'm here to give you super sex.' And there's a slight pause, and he says, 'Alright, I'll take the soup.'"

        "speech": "FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA: Well, George [Lucas] is the closest thing I have to a younger brother, so you can imagine the affection and the pride I have in him. But there were so many... I'm about three or four or five years older than the wonderful generation that did so much, so I'm very proud of them. And the fact that this is the Thalberg Award is, the significance is not lost on me. Because this is an award for producing. This is not about my own writing and my own filmmaking, but this is about the talent that I came to really value. And it's more about 'American Graffiti' and 'The Black Stallion' and 'Koyaanisqatsi,' and I could go on, about 'Napoleon' performed in the Radio City Music Hall with a live orchestra. That happened because I'd always heard from my father that in the days when he was a boy, when he went to the movies to see 'Don Juan' or 'The Thief of Bagdad,' that there was a symphony orchestra. And I said, gee, I'd love to see that. And the way to see it was to take the 'Napoleon' restoration and get a full-out symphony orchestra and perform it. And it was a wonderful hit. It was riveting. And I'm so proud of the fact that that tradition of once again combining live music with the great silent films, or with any film, has become really something that we can see.  I don't have any words prepared. In fact, I'm shooting a picture, and last night – we're shooting nights, so I went to bed around four in the morning last night. And I said, well, I'll just get up and thank everyone for this honor. I remember seeing the Thalberg Award given and thought, wow, that's fantastic. And in a way, although I still consider myself a relatively young person, I'm one of the few people you'll meet today who actually worked for Jack Warner and had him say, 'No fog on the lake!' Or Sam Goldwyn when he said to me, you know, [imitating:] 'Your films, I like your films for the spontinuity' [purposefully mispronounces], he said to me. So I had the pleasure – I do a great Samuel Goldwyn, as does Warren [Beatty]. He said to me, Samuel Goldwyn said to me, he said [imitating:] 'What are you doing? You're a Goldwyn Scholar. You're so great.' I said, well I want to direct, too. [Imitating:] 'Direct? You should be a writer. Writer, you are a writer. You're a great writer. Write! Write! Write!' So a year later I made a film, and I got a letter: Mr. Goldwyn would like to see you. He said, [imitating:] 'Oh, you're a Goldwyn Scholar –' This is really the way he talked, by the way, I'm not... [Imitating:] 'You're a Goldwyn Scholar.' He said, 'What are you doing?' I said, well, I'm thinking of writing a new film. [Imitating:] 'Writing? You're a director now! Writers are nothing. Direct! Direct! Direct!' So, you know, Adolph Zukor, Darryl Zanuck, who incidentally, as was said, was the first winner of the Thalberg Award, and I think he won it more than once as a matter of fact. So I have a great love of the original Hollywood tradition, certainly going back to the silents which were some of the most beautiful movies ever made. Murnau, by the way, had said himself, he said, 'The coming of sound to movies was inevitable, but it came too soon.' It came too soon, which there is some truth in. Those were beautiful films.  I, you know, I'm so proud of my family: my wife of forty-eight years, Eleanor, who's here; my fabulous children. I made a very wise decision when I was a young guy. I said to my wife, if I ever go away for more than two weeks I want to take the kids out of school – imagine that today – take the kids out of school. I'm taking them with me. And we always did, and as a result we had our family together through all of those adventures in the Philippines and what have you. So, and then of course the other children in the Schwartzman family, and of course in, I can't say the Cage family, but we're very proud of Nicolas as you can imagine. So I could tell you lots of stories but I haven't prepared any notes or anything other than to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And my admiration for the tradition of Irving Thalberg and, of course, of the fantastic producers who have won it, and not the least of it is Dino. You know, what a loss, to lose... [imitating:] 'Dino, eh. You know, Francis...' I don't do Dino so well. I think Warren does Dino. At any rate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank my family. I thank my friends. So many of my friends are here tonight and people I've worked with, my colleagues, and the people whose films I've admired. Thank you so much. Thank you."

So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.  First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this. All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are. Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be. And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen: Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.  And all the people who have been rooting for me back home. Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones. And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this. And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family. And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her. Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage. Thank you very much [unintelligible]."

[pointing to the audience]  KAREN O'HARA: Tim, this is yours. Thank you.  ROBERT STROMBERG: Meet me with a saw because half of this is yours. There's just one last bit of art direction for a Tim Burton film [puts a miniature 'Mad Hatter' wig and hat on his Oscar]... and there it is. Thank you, Academy. And to my wife, my kids, and I dedicate this to my dad. Thank you."

It's great to be part of such a great group of people. The story 'Alice in Wonderland' was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all. The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton. Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent 'Hatter,' Mia's 'Alice' for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight. We had the support of a production team headed by Richard Zanuck and Katterli Frauenfelder, supported by Joe Roth, Suzanne and Jen Todd, and Disney, but I couldn't have done it without my team: Christine Cantella and my entire group. Thank you all very much."

But most of all, thank you to my parents, my mum and dad who are in the audience tonight. And I know there's been a lot of thanking of mums, but this is slightly different because my mum in 2007 was invited by some Australian friends—she's Australian—in London to a fringe theater play reading of an unproduced, unrehearsed play called 'The King's Speech.' Now she's never been invited to a play reading in her entire life before. She almost didn't go because it didn't sound exactly promising, but thank god she did because she came home, rang me up and said, 'Tom, I think I found your next film.' So with this [holding up the Oscar] tonight, I honor you. And the moral of the story is: Listen to your mother."

His was an original screenplay; this is an adaptation of a book by Ben Mezrich, so I'm accepting this on his behalf as well. There are a lot of people who've worked hard in my corner for a long time and it seems like the right moment to thank them: my assistant Lauren Lohman; my researcher Ian Reichbach; my long suffering press rep, Joy Fehily, and all the women of Prime; Rich Heller, Bill Tanner, Andy Forshay*; my agents Ari Emanuel and Jason Spitz, who never blow my cover and reveal that I would happily do this for free; and my mom and dad, who made a life for me where I get to be a part of nights like this.  I wrote this movie but David Fincher made this movie, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness. Someone this talented has no business being the nicest guy in the world, but he is, and he made the movie of any screenwriter's dreams. He had help from Amy Pascal, Michael Lynton and everyone at Sony whose only mandate was to make it good. From Dana Brunetti, Ceán Chaffin, Mike De Luca, and America's best living film producer, Scott Rudin. And from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Armie Hammer again, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara, and a cast and crew that followed their leader's example: that good enough was never good enough. This movie is going to be a source of pride for me every day for the rest of my life. That is an un-repayable gift. All I can say is thank you.  Roxy Sorkin, your father just won the Academy Award.

I want to say hi to my kids, and it's six in the morning in Paris so you should go to bed in thirty seconds. I want to say to my wife, Bérénice Bejo, who's here, that I love you. But it's not just that, it's about the movie. You inspired the movie and you're the soul of the movie and the positive feeling of the movie. Thank you for being this in the movie and in my life. And I want to thank three person: I want to thank Billy Wilder. I want to thank Billy Wilder. And I want to thank Billy Wilder. Thank you very much."

I just wanna ask you a question: If an actor's nightmare is being on stage buck naked and not knowing his lines... what the heck do you call this?  [Laughs] I mean, look at this! I've been on this stage, with a great audience - and thank you. I had my clothes on, I knew my words, and then out from the wings steps Sir Ben Kingsley, and he hands me an Oscar! Frankly... frankly, what the heck else would you call that but an actor's wet dream? [Laughs]  And aside from that, how do I feel? Well, I'm more than flabbergasted. There's a word I've learned here in Britain. They'd say, 'I'm gobsmacked!' [Laughs] And that's the only word that I can think of that's appropriate for this improbable moment in my life. Improbable because, well, let's start with my introduction to motion pictures. Four years old, sitting on a bench in the dark in Mississippi. Two storekeepers have taken a bedsheet and stretched it between their stores. One sells popcorn, the other sells soda pop. Is that familiar? And when those images start emitting sound on that bedsheet, and the shootouts and the fisticuffs start, I simply can't handle it. And I dive under the bench in terror, begging, screaming, 'Make 'em stop! Somebody make 'em stop doing that.'  Well, I can't make 'em stop so eventually I joined them. And for half a century now, being a journeyman actor in my own fashion, I still spend more time on [taps the stage with his foot] boards like these than in front of cameras like those [pointing to the back of the room]. I sometimes feel like that lone wolf lurking around the, outside the glow of the cinema campfire, lurching in to snatch a morsel of movie now and then. Now sometimes those morsels I'm quite proud of. But you cannot be a cinema actor and conduct your career like I've done, and not end up in some of the worst movies ever committed to celluloid. But I want to tell you something [laughs], I want to tell you something. I so cherish them that I refuse to name them. You'll just have to Google, my friends, because tonight belongs to Oscar.  I want to thank the Academy, the Board of Governors. I want to thank Mr. Sid Ganis for flying my little golden friend over the ocean. And thank you, Sir Ben Kingsley, for presenting it to me. Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you deeply honored, mighty grateful, and just plain gobsmacked. Thank you."

[Laughs.] But I do remember with great fondness everyone at this table and how much they have meant to me in my life. I will never forget tonight. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all.  This had been an incredible joy. One of the greatest I've ever had in my whole life. I have loved being a makeup artist so much, but this kind of puts the crown, a cap, on all of that, all of that.

        "speech": "OPRAH WINFREY: I didn't prepare a speech because I just wanted to feel whatever this is. Because Maria is so correct, it's very difficult for me to open myself to receive what people have to offer. And so tonight I came prepared to be open, and I would like to thank the Board of Governors for the opportunity to receive the love, and the Oscar.  I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, is a part of my being. It's a part of why I am here. And what I know for sure is the only reason I am here is because Quincy Jones was in a hotel in Chicago in 1985, and was taking a shower, and was there for a lawsuit, that somebody was suing Michael Jackson saying that they were the girl of the song, or whatever. And he saw me on 'A.M. Chicago' and said, 'I think that's Sofia.' So I would like to thank Quincy Jones, who is in Dubai right now.  But Quincy Jones was a part of a divine manifestation for me. Those of you, anybody here who's ever watched 'The Oprah Show' has heard me tell the story of how I first watched, first read The New York Times review on a Sunday about 'The Color Purple.' I read the review, because the book review is the first thing I ever look at on The New York Times. And Stedman and I to this day, it's like, 'You want the book review?' I go, 'You read the front section. I'll read the book review first.' And I read the book review of 'The Color Purple.' And was in my pajamas, put on my coat, in Baltimore, and went to the bookstore and got the book. And from that moment became, literally, drawn to, in some kind of mystical way, to that story. Mainly because the character... The first line of the book is, 'Dear God, I'm fourteen years old...' And I had lived that life and couldn't imagine that someone was able to put into words what I had already experienced.  And so began this journey that I was able to really understand that God's hand, or power greater than myself, 'the forces,' as Sidney Poitier calls them, were engaged in leading my life to a plane and a level that I had not even imagined. But I released myself to those forces, and literally said inside myself, 'Thy will be done.' And as a part of that journey, to be here tonight... Maria touched on it but it is really -- Stedman and I talk about this all the time. It's unimaginable if you are not a black, former colored girl, born in Mississippi in 1954, it's impossible for you to even know what this journey has meant. I know Larry Gordon, Mississippi Jew [laughs], almost as rare as I am [laughs], can begin to understand what that means, to be born in 1954 in Mississippi.  When I saw 'The Help,' and first heard that there was gonna be a movie called 'The Help,' and first read the book, 'The Help,' I thought that is my story. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid. The mother before her was a slave. My mother was a maid. My grandmother's greatest dream for me was that I would grow up in a family and have a career where... She used to say, 'I hope you get some good white folks. I hope you get some good white folks like I have. I have good white folks.' And the only picture I have of my grandmother is of her holding a white child in her maid's uniform. So, the journey from Kosciusko, Mississippi, where nobody ever even imagined it possible that you could be anything other than a maid who had some good white folks, who would give you clothes and would let you take food home on the holidays. It's unimaginable that I would be standing before you, voted by the Board of Governors... It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It is unimaginable! And so when I say thank you, the thank you comes from a place deeper than even I know, Sharon [Stone]. Even deeper than I know. Because it's not just from me, it's from everybody who made me possible. It's from every shoulder I ever stood on, every bridge I ever crossed, every story that's ever told, every story that ever imagined this day to be possible.  I thank you for this award. And I will... What this means for me is, I woke up this morning, I said, 'What is Oscar? What is a... Oscar...?' You know, I grew up wanting to be an actress and my father, being a barber and coming from the culture that he came from, said, 'No daughter of mine's going to be laying on some casting couch.' That was his idea of what being an actress meant. And so when the opportunity showed itself to me, to be a part of 'The Color Purple,' it really is, was divine intervention, just to be a part of being able to share that story. I knew that something special, magical, a door had opened to me. And after that door came 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and many other doors. But a door opened to me through the magic and majesty of film. The ability to tell stories in such a way that you connect to the heart-space of people, and you connect to the place where people really live, and not just live but where their souls abide, that is what great films do. And to this day, 'The Color Purple' experience is one of the greatest experiences of my life.  And yes, I'd like to do more films, but to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award means more to me than any film, any acclaim, even an Oscar. Because what it says is that you all get it. The Board of Governors, you get it. You get that what I've been trying to do and what I've been trying to say all these years is that every single person, Ayanna, and all of you and every person I've spoken to in over fifty thousand interviews of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' every single person who incarnates here to the planet matters. Your life matters. You matter. What you do matters. The fact that you are here, that you are born, that your presence here on earth means something. That's what I've been trying to say through all of my work, be it film, be it 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' be it the magazine, it is that we all matter. And what I really, really, really, really know for sure, is that this award to me represents all of you, sitting in a room -- I don't know how this happens. The governors, I don't know who you are. But when I got the call from Tom [Sherak] I was literally on a hike in Hawaii, and I get the call. The Academy has called! Security comes for me and says, 'You must come down from the mountain now! Stop the hike because Tom from the Academy is on the phone.' And then Larry Gordon is saying, 'Answer the phone! Answer the phone!' And I'm like, whaaat...? Okay! What this really means is that you all understand that what I've been trying to do and what I've tried to say all these years, is that all us can make a difference through the life that we live.  And when you understand, as I do, that this to me, I'm gonna allow this Oscar... Like I've interviewed everybody over the years and say, 'Where do you keep your Oscar?' And people are always so nonchalant about it and they say: 'Oh my, I keep it in my bathroom.' 'I don't know where mine is.' 'My sister has it.' Well my new sister, my sister who I just discovered last year, this time last year, is here. Pat is here. I will say she will not have it; I will have it! And it will be on, I will keep it on my desk in front of me to remind me that you have voted for me. You have voted for what I believe is the essence of why we're all here. We're all here to help each other. We're all here to use our lives in service to one another. And nobody who has ever, ever done any kind of work... I mean I run a girls school and those girls are gonna be graduating from college. The first in their families to ever graduate from college. The first in their families to ever graduate high school. And those girls are coming to the United States and they're going to Wellesley and they're going to Brown and they're going to Tufts and they're going to all the great universities. And I will tell you that anybody who's ever done that, done any kind of work where you are hands on, where you're up on the phone and you're on at four o'clock in the morning and two in the morning and whatever, you're not doing that because you think you're gonna get an Oscar one day. You're doing it because you believe in the power of every human being who has come to this planet. And you know that these are all bodies, but inside the bodies there's a soul and a spirit and a power greater than we know. And for me this Oscar will represent love from all of you. I thank you for your vote of love and I will use it to increase the open space in my heart to continue to do the great and good work that we've all come to do and serve. Thank you so much."

I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that 'Lincoln' shouldn't be a musical.  My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much."

There are literally thousands of people to thank, so thankfully I'm not gonna thank them now. I'm going to thank everybody personally in the next few weeks, but there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. I want to acknowledge my partner in crime and my great friend, George Clooney, who... Everybody should be so lucky to have a partner who is as talented and as humorous and who has as much integrity. So, thank you, George. I want to thank my beautiful wife Lysa; you make everything better. And to our kids, Maya and Olivia, I love you guys. I hope your old man's not embarrassing you up here. The reason I wanted to speak first – I wanted to speak before Ben – was Ben is a producer on the film and he is also our director. And I thought it would be awkward for Ben to thank himself, but it's not awkward for me. So on behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben. You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film; couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of 'Argo': Ben Affleck.  BEN AFFLECK: Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. I know eventually that thing is gonna start to go, so forgive me if this is a little bit quick. I want to acknowledge Steven Spielberg, who I feel is a genius and a towering talent among us. I want to acknowledge the other eight films. There are eight great films that have every right, as much a right to be up here as we do. I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what they did, and for many of them who didn't even get nominated this year.  I want to thank, you know, I mean, Jack McNiece*, and Jerry Speck*, and Marty Brest, and my brother, and my mom and dad, and Patrick Whitesell, and Tony Mendez, who let us do his story. Thank you. And I'm gonna forget – I thank everyone in the movie, on the movie, worked on the movie, did anything with this movie, gets thanked. I want to thank Canada. I want to thank our friends in Iran living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife – who I don't normally associate with Iran, but... I want to thank you for working on our marriage for ten Christmases. It's good. It is work but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with.  And I just want to say, you know, I was here fifteen years ago or something, and, you know, I had no idea what I was doing. I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid, and I went out, you know, and I never thought that I would be back here. And I am because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood. You know what I mean? I couldn't get 'em a job. I want to thank them and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up.

To receive this award from two of our greatest talents and two people I am lucky to be able to call my friends is a distinct honor of its own, as it is to be here among movie legends Mr. Pennebaker, George Stevens and Hal Needham.  My story is of mentors. People who give of their time and their talents, of their words and their wisdom. People who encourage all of us to reach for more and in doing so inspire us. Inspire us to strive for exellence not only in ourselves but in each other. My first mentors, my parents, they gave me life and they gave me a deep appreciation for what it is to give to others. There are days between my second and third breakfasts when I think how lucky I was to have been mentored at such an early age. My mom, she passed away a little over a month ago, and I really regret that I never told her this enough. But my father is here tonight and, Dad, I want to say now just how much you mean to me and how much I love and appreciate you for all you have given to me.  Mentors. John Lindsay, the late, great mayor of New York, taught me the power of believing. Believing in an ideal. For when he looked out across a sea of problems and people in need, most of whom asked for nothing, said he wanted to try and make their world just a little bit better. And he did. This was an early lesson and a simple truth that each of us can and should make a difference.  Kirk Douglas. I met Kirk, as most of the world did, larger than life on a giant silver screen. Spartacus, a true hero. Then I had the honor of meeting him in real life and he was an even larger hero in person. It's Kirk who taught me you haven't learned to live until you've learned to give. It's a statement that echoes loudly and it is in many ways the mantra of Hollywood. Think of George Clooney and the Sudan. Think of Steven Spielberg and Shoah. Think of Angelina Jolie and the United Nations. Think of David Geffen, well, everything. The list is long and I am honored to be among the many.  In fact, standing here alone doesn't feel quite right to me. It projects a bit of a false image. Because mostly all I did was pick up the phone and ask you. It's you who did it. You who give of your time, your talent, your money, your hearts. Because that's what you do, that is what Hollywood does. And I know what it is to be asked. I was asked by Lew and Edie Wasserman, mentors. They asked me to take a moment to consider the Motion Picture Television Fund, and the ask was all that it took. A place to care for many of our nation's great artists and storytellers, a place for mentors to be safe and to be appreciated. You saw their faces, heard their voices in that video, and there is so much more. I stand here tonight on their behalf with particular pride because this award bears the name of Jean Hersholt. It was he nearly seventy-five years ago who was among the founders of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. I'm tempted to say it's the circle of life, but a circle implies something complete and we at the Fund have a greater horizon.  I will end with my thanks to the person who is every single day my greatest mentor. We met back in the John Lindsay days and we are here today as partners in giving and partners in living. The mother of my amazing children, she is my wife, and she is my life. Marilyn. And to all of you, I want to thank you again for giving so generously of your time, of your talent and of your hearts. You might say that all of us who work in the film industry, we actually live in two worlds. There's the imaginary world we project on the screen and then there's the real world that we live in every day. All of the other Oscars, they pay tribute to the talent that goes into the creation of those imaginary worlds. I believe this particular Hersholt Award is a recognition of the extraordinary generosity of our industry towards improving the real world that we all share. And it is with that in mind and, I think, really on your behalf that I humbly and proudly accept this amazing recognition. Thank you so very much."

Because he's got more funny stories – but when you're a director that's not all good, because he's got the damn cast over here telling 'em stories and I'm waiting on him. I'd say, Ruddy, let 'em up. He'd let 'em up, they'd come over. Once I cut, they'd be back over listening to Ruddy. [To Ruddy next to him on stage:] Are you gonna stand here and listen to me or are you gonna sit down?  Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You know something? You're looking at the luckiest man alive. And lucky to be alive. As a kid folks didn't think too much of me, of what I was gonna amount to. The reason, I was a sharecropper's son, way back in the hills of Arkansas during the Great Depression. With eight years of education. But for sure, for sure, my mom is looking down on tonight with a big smile on her face – sorry. By 1954, I'd served three years in the military as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division where I made over four hundred jumps. Most of those jumps were made testing parachutes. And on a lot of weekends I worked an aerial thrill show, which is perfect training for my first movie, 'The Spirit of St. Louis,' that starred Jimmy Stewart. They were prepared to shoot a barnstorming sequence, all they needed was two guys to work on top of and underneath a couple of biplanes. The production manager was talking to my partner and I about how much we're going to charge them for the first stunt. Hell, I didn't know. I'd never done it before. I had no idea what'd be appropriate. But trying to get as much as I could I said, two thousand dollars every time we do it. A voice behind me said, 'For two thousand dollars I'll do it.' I looked around, it was the director, Billy Wilder. He walked past us, went down to the planes, climbed up on the top wing, buckled in. I said, this fool's got to be kidding. But he wasn't. He motioned the pilot to wind it up and took off. They bounced down across the field, made a couple of low passes and landed. When Billy Wilder climbed down off of that plane he says – he had a twinkle in his eye and a little smile on his face – and he said, 'Now how much do you want?' We agreed that a thousand dollars would be just right. I worked six weeks on 'Spirit' when they paid me more money than this cotton-pickin' kid had seen in his life. I now had a decision, a goal. I was gonna be a Hollywood stuntman.  When I got into the business the stunt equipment was, adequate. I know, because I broke fifty-six bones, my back twice, punctured a lung, had a shoulder replaced and knocked out a few teeth trying to use that stuff. But never believing that and the fact that that's the way it's always done, I came up with a few pieces of equipment that made the stunts more real, more active and a lot, lot easier. Safer. And that's really what I was looking for. A way to save myself some trips to the hospital.  You know, I didn't get here by myself; I had a lot of help. A lot of help. And I need to thank some of those folks. Like all the stuntmen and women who worked with me and for me, and made me look like I knew what I was doing. All the producers, directors, and stars that requested me. The Academy Board of Governors, for deciding to give me this award, this great award. And my wife Ellyn, for putting up with me for all these years, nursing me back to health many times, but best of all, the neverending love. Honey, you're the best; thank you. One last thing. I want to thank the entire Hollywood community for allowing me to be part of it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it."

        "speech": "D.A. PENNEBAKER: I'm gonna put some notes out here, but hopefully I won't get lost in them. [Looking at the Oscar:] Kind of amazing. I mean I... Everybody here probably has one of these already, right? I'm the last one to get it. Alright, well, I want to thank Hawk Koch who called me up – I thought it was early in the morning but Chris says it was late at night – and told me he was from the Academy and that they were gonna give me one of these. And I did say, are you kidding? It seems, you know, New York is a long way from here. And people in New York who make films never expect to even go to Oscarland, much less get one. So it's kind of a... I mean, and there's also the distance between the 16mm film and the 35mm, and the 40mm, and the 70mm, and whatever. So it's a long stretch, and being here now, I'm kinda trying to deal with it. It's hard.  Anyway, I have to thank the Board of Governors who made this possible. And I want to thank – well I want to congratulate Jeffrey Katzenberg, whom I just met. Actually we almost met in New York at a screening, but not quite. He was a few rows ahead of me and we were all getting out. Hal Needham, whom I don't know. And George Stevens whom I know from long ago when I was on an NEA panel. And I think he was getting some funding from that panel, so we got to go for two or three days out here, and he arranged a really nice thing with starlets and... It was interesting. It was great. I liked him for that. And then I... And Michael Moore, who probably is responsible for everything that's happening here tonight, as far as I can see, but whom, you know... I mean I, Michael's amazing. He's like Chaplin. He's created a kind of... The minute you see the hat and his head you know exactly what's gonna happen. That's fantastic. You know, very few people can do that. I think that's called branding. Anyway he, just knowing that Michael's on the case I sleep better, that's all I can tell you. And I love him. He's just, well, he's a man who is passionate about seeing fairness take place, and that's a hard thing in our time.  Anyway. And Bobby Neuwirth, who's somewhere here. He was Dylan's road manager. And I met him with Bobby down at this bar in the Village. That was when Dylan'd say I have an idea for doing a film whereby I'll take some pieces of cardboard and we'll write things on, I'll write words from a song on 'em, and I'll throw them down. Is that a good idea? And I said, it's a fantastic idea. So we brought about a thousand shirt cardboards with us to England when we made the film there. And the thing Neuwirth was, from the very beginning, and this is always amazing. It's like meeting your, the woman you're gonna marry or the child that you want to raise. He knew somehow instinctively exactly what I was gonna do. And he often made it happen; he made it possible. He didn't arrange anything or direct anything, but he was willing whatever we needed to happen. And that was the first time I'd ever run across that. Actually, it was the first time I'd made a movie about a person with dialog, so there were a lot of new things going on there for me.  Anyway, the person that I have to thank the hardest is the love of my life, Chris, whom when I first met her, she was looking for a job. She said – but later I think, I decided she was really looking to get her hands on my camera, which I thought was reasonable. And I right away could see that she could be the partner that I really always was looking for. The person who had the same, was driven by the same passion for a certain kind of film that I was. And that's thirty-six years ago, and we haven't changed... Although when we make a film – yeah, give her a hand. She's so beautiful; she spent two hours getting made up tonight and she looks fantastic. Anyway, she and I have made a lot of films together. We made, of course, 'The War Room' with Nick Doob, who I think is here. And when we make films, when you, shooting them you're great friends. Because there's nothing but problems to be solved, so you're pals. And then you sit down at either the Steenbeck, or whatever editing machine there is, and it all begins. You get divorced about four times a week. But you know, it's a process. Even though you're practically choking each other to death over each editing decision, there's nothing in the world I love better than doing that with her. It's just my favorite thing. So even if I had nothing else to do, that would be the thing I would choose that would be the best fun. So anyway, that's, she knows all about this because I tell her all the time.  And we also... Al and Chris together made the film with Al Franken, with Nick Doob and Al Franken. And that was the – well I tell ya, I was really surprised when Al came up and introduced me there. That was... he's such a... Well that's an interesting film. I mean, I don't know if any of you've seen it. I mean, I've seen it a lot of times, but... I was, for that film I was the producer. And any of you who make documentary film know the role of the producer. I might as well have stayed home; I don't do very much. But they made a fantastic film. And I think that when, you know, the thing about it was that here was a guy who was invited to parties because he'd make everybody laugh. He was kind of a party clown and he had been an originator of SNL, so he was really very good at it. You know, he, but he was also a person who could see when things were going wrong, and he could see who the problems were and who was doing it. And so in the course of that film – and boy, it's very seldom you make a film about somebody and see them change, really change their lives. That's like magic happening. And he decided he was gonna run for the Senate. And it's, and there was this story he told which was, it wasn't really a dirty story but it had kind of dirty implications you would say. I mean you wouldn't want your five-year-old to tell it in school. And he used to tell it at big gatherings like this and everybody would laugh and laugh. And somebody said to him, 'You're running for Senate now, you can't tell that story.' And he said 'What! I can't tell that story? What's wrong with that story?' 'Can't do it.' 'Okay,' he said. 'I won't tell that story.' And that was the end of the film. But you know it was such an amazing thing – I hear him laughing out there. It was such an amazing thing because he would do anything. He saw that being a Senator was so much more important than anything he'd ever done before that he was ready to even not tell that story. And I thought that was a show of character that I really loved.  Anyhow. Beyond that I think, we made a film with Roger Friedman. It was called the, 'Only the Strong Survive.' It was sort of an interesting thing, because Roger is a New York Jew. And to all the musicians in Memphis, he was the enemy, right? The New York Jew came out and stole their music and never gave them any money back. And when Roger arrived in Memphis, we thought, well, we'll have a little problem. They loved Roger! Because he's seen, he knew every song they ever sang and he'd been at every concert they'd ever seen. They, the people were not very interested in us because they didn't know who we were. We were just two filmmakers from New York. But seeing Roger in that atmosphere and to follow him from the kind of talent that Stax and all those various music originators came up with was, well it was very exciting for me. It was the kind of music I didn't know much about. And at the end of that film I really felt like I'd been through some kind of a college course in something or other. And Roger did it. We just followed Roger. We didn't know what to look at or who to listen to, and he took us to those places. So I'm very grateful to what he was able to do. And still, you know, for my birthday party he said, 'I got a surprise for you. Aretha Franklin is coming to your party.' And she did. We sat down; I talked for a half an hour to Aretha Franklin. And I'll never get over that; that was my birthday present from Roger.  Well anyway. And then I have to thank my family. A horde of people sitting at a table over there. And I think at least one grandchild and one on the way. Chelsea, she's about to whelp. And you know, that my family all, we, I tell you it's grown so, I think I have eight children and then I think I have thirteen or fourteen – I'm not sure which – grandchildren. So Thanksgivings are impossible. And this is the first time we've all been sitting together. It's kind of wonderful. It's a family reunion, and that's kind of nice. And then there's Frazer, my son [applause] – yeah, right. Who by some magic of DNN, DNA – whatever it is – has managed to be older than I am. So he's our boss and runs our company, and has, which he's done successfully for thirty-five years or so. For us success is, you know, not cashing huge amounts of money at the bank but being able to make the next film. Because it takes us a little longer to make a film than maybe we should. You know, we have to argue and fight over it, and that, you know, it's always difficult. And he's made that so that happens. You know, even if he wasn't my son I would have to be very grateful and loving to him because that's an amazing thing to do. That's an act of love.  And then there's people that I've worked with. Jim Desmond who, with Nick Proferes, two people who had kind of, were neophytes in our organization. They'd just come to work with us to find out how these films were made. And when we were at Monterey, I thought, Ravi Shankar? Who's Ravi Shankar? You know, nobody here is gonna be interested in this music. So I said, you guys can go film Ravi Shankar music and all the rest of us heavy filmmakers will film the people in the audience. The L.A. factions and the San Francisco factions were sort of making peace but also heavily at war. And halfway through that thing that they did, which was a fantastic piece of music, I began... Everybody was really intent on listening and I could hear that it was kinda more than I thought it was gonna be, so I said, I'd better go down and see how those guys are doing. And I went down in the front and there the two of them were just gunning it. They were so, I was thrilled just watching them film. And I didn't even know what they were getting, but I could see that they were really into it. So I was able to film the audience. I didn't even bother to do anything. And that's, when I looked at the rushes I saw that that film that they had shot was the, was gonna be the ending of the film. It was the most exciting thing that we'd done there. And the thing that was amazing, and I tell students to watch that sequence and you'll see two people learning how to be filmmakers in less than an hour. And it's an amazing thing to watch because they, in the beginning they weren't sure what to shoot. And by the end they were just so right on it that it's hair-raising. And that was those, that was Nick and Jim Desmond.  And then I think the one person that was very instrumental in my education as a filmmaker was Bobby Neuwirth. And he sort of knew how to function in a group of people without disturbing them, and yet watching what they really did, not what they pretended to do. And that was something that I needed to learn because I had never really filmed a number – most of my films were like 'Daybreak Express.' I just got Duke Ellington music, and you can't, you know, what can you do worse than that?  And then I think later that we worked with Joan Churchill and Alan Barker, and we did a film 'Searching for Jimi Hendrix.' And it was so marvelous to have somebody that I knew on the other coast so we didn't have to – we had no budget for it so we couldn't come flying out here to do something. And Joan and Alan, what they did was just as good as anything we could have done. So it taught me that people were learning and getting as good as they needed to and that was a very exciting possibility. And then one day R.J. Cutler and Wendy Ettinger came to visit us, and neither of them had ever made a film – am I going too long, do you think? I don't want to overwhelm this thing here. But, alright, well anyway. They had never made a film and they said why aren't you making a film about this election. And we said, what election? You know. And so they really knew – well, I'm getting mixed signals from my family here. And they said... we said, well we don't have any money and we don't know anybody there. And at this point I think Clinton was in fourth place in New York. So even though my enthusiasm was for Clinton I didn't see how I could make that into a film. And they said, we'll get you a little money, which they did. And we'll find out, we'll call up and get you some people to let you in. And they did that and we made 'The War Room' with them. And that was sort of a marvelous thing. You're saying... Oh, alright.  So anyway, I want to say I'm really grateful for this amazing award. And what it tells me, or what I get from it is that, as kind of a foreigner from New York who all my life, you know, everything I learned about films was in watching the movies that you people out here made. I mean, that's my education in film. And that watching those films and thinking about this award has made me feel that finally, between here and New York, there's finally some kind of a bridge. And that you guys all somehow now consider us fellow filmmakers. And that's wonderful. Thank you."

        "speech": "GEORGE STEVENS, JR.: Thank you so much. And thank you, dear Sidney, and wonderful Annette. Sitting out here with all of you enjoying this wonderful evening, it made me think back to the first time I saw one of these. It was a long time ago. It was in, it was on March 15, 1944. I was eleven years old. My father was away at war, preparing for D-Day. He'd been nominated for directing for a movie called 'The More the Merrier.' And I was planning on going to a twi-night double-header between the Hollywood Stars and the San Francisco Seals down at Gilmore Field over there on Beverly. And my mother told me that instead we were going to Grauman's Chinese and that if my father won this award I was going to accept it. I remember putting on an itchy suit and going to the Chinese with my mother and my grandmother. And my mother saying that, how gracious the stars sitting around us were – Jean Arthur, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman – when the other's picture would win for art direction or sound, and they would applaud, and it was so nice. And then a fine director of the day, Mark Sandrich, came on the stage to present the award for best director. And I was ready. But you should understand this. I knew the batting averages of every player in the Hollywood Stars' lineup, but I had never heard of 'Casablanca.' Mark Sandrich read the names, opened the envelope, and he said: Michael Curtiz, 'Casablanca.' And unlike the gracious ladies sitting around me – my mother said that I had a deep and rather resonant voice for a boy my age – I said, 'We wuz robbed!'  Well you see, I mean, I didn't grow up to come here. I wanted to be a sportswriter. My heroes were Grantland Rice and Red Smith. And maybe it was partly a little thing of self-preservation, that I didn't want to devote my life to becoming the second-best film director in my family. But, it a... you know, I had this legacy. My grandmother, Georgia Woodthorpe, was the great actress of the age in San Francisco. She played 'Ophelia' to Edwin Booth's 'Hamlet.' And her daughter, Georgie Cooper, married Landers Stevens. They were both actor and actress matinee idols in San Francisco, and Landers was a director. And when the movies ruined the theater they moved to Hollywood. The next time you see 'Swing Time,' that handsome, grey-haired man who plays the father of the girl that Fred Astaire stands up at her wedding, that's Landers Stevens. And my other grandmother, Alice Howell, she came here and starred in the first six films that Charlie Chaplin made and went on to make a hundred more. And my mother, she was a Mack Sennett bathing beauty until she retired to raise me. So, it's sort of in our blood. And my daughter Caroline is here; she's a documentary filmmaker. My son Michael is a writer-producer-director. He's in Washington tonight, producing the Kennedy Center Honors. Probably making me irrelevant. And so they are fifth generation in show business. Which makes Liz and me especially proud of our son David, with his doctoral degree from Harvard and his company called Symphony Learning, he is teaching children to learn. And at long last he has proven that a Stevens can make a living in the real world. David.  I went back to the Oscars years later, this time with my father, and I sat next to him the night he won for 'A Place in the Sun.' And riding home that night, he was driving the car – it was different in those days – and the Oscar was on the seat between us. And I was pretty excited. And I think he thought I was a little too excited. He leaned over, smiled, and he said something that shaped my life. He said, we'll have a better idea what kind of a film this is in about twenty-five years. He was talking about the test of time. And it was the test of time that was the underlying idea and the ethic of the American Film Institute and later the Kennedy Center Honors. So I thank Dad for that and for opening the door for me to a creative life that has been so rich and gifted me with so many wonderful friends in our profession. And the test of time, I've seen a couple of pictures this fall that I am confident will stand the test of time. And I think it is so important that there are filmmakers among us who will swim into the currents, who will challenge the industrialization of moviemaking to make films that are filled with passion and glory and pity and sacrifice, and reached to the depths of our humanity. And so thinking of that I thank the Academy, I thank the Board of Governors. And this means a great deal to me because of our shared values about the importance and the value of film. So tonight I say, here's to the great films of the future. And I should add, tonight I wasn't robbed. Thanks so much."

Thank you to the members of the Academy for this honor; my dear friends, who are here tonight; Gena and George, for your kind words. To my hero, Louis Zamperini. The cast of 'Blood and Honey.' And most of all to my family. My love, your support and your guidance make everything that I do possible. Madd – I'm not going to cry, I promise. [Laughs] I won't embarrass you. You and your brothers and sisters are my happiness, and there's no greater honor in this world than being your mom.  I'm very humbled to be here tonight among so many extraordinary artists. My mother loved art. She loved film. She supported any crazy thing I did, but whenever it had meaning she made a point of telling me that is what film is for. And she never had a career as an artist. She never had the opportunity to express herself beyond her theater class. But she wanted more than for herself, she wanted for Jamie and I to know what it is to have a life as artists, and she gave us that chance. She drove me to every audition and she would wait in the car for hours. Always make me feel really good all the times I didn't get the job, and when I did we would jump up and down and scream and yell like little girls. She wasn't really the best critic since she never had anything unkind to say, but she did give me love and confidence and, above all, she was very clear that nothing would mean anything if I didn't live a life of use to others.  And I didn't know what that meant for a long time. I came into this business young and worried about my own experiences and my own pain, and it was only when I began to travel and look and live beyond my home, did I understand my responsibility to others. And when I met survivors of war and famine and rape, I learned what life is like for most people in this world and how fortunate I was to have food to eat, a roof over my head, a safe place to live, and the joy of having my family safe and healthy. And I realized how sheltered I had been and I was determined never to be that way again.  We are all, everyone in this room, so fortunate. I have never understood why some people are lucky enough to be born with the chance that I had, to have this path in life, and why across the world there's a woman just like me, with the same abilities and the same desires, the same work ethic and love for her family, who would most likely make better films and better speeches, only she sits in a refugee camp and she has no voice. She worries about what her children will eat, how to keep them safe, and if they'll ever be allowed to return home. I don't know why this is my life and that's hers. I don't understand that. But I will do as my mother asked, and I will do the best I can with this life to be of use. And to stand here today means that I did as she asked, and if she were alive she'd be very proud. So thank you for that."

You know, when I was first asked by the Academy who I would like to introduce me, I thought carefully and I came to a conclusion that the one person who really knew about my early work was Robert, Robert Osborne. I mean, so many of the legendary directors and producers who gave me such incredible opportunities in film, they were long gone, you know. I was still around. But thanks to Turner Classic Movies and Robert those great films are shown and studied and discussed by students everywhere, as well as seen by a huge general audience. So, thank you, TMC, and thank you, Robert, for keeping me alive all these years. [Laughs]  Emma, bless your heart. 'Aunt Adelaide' was a wonderful moment for me because I had sort of pulled out completely of everything when my darling husband Peter died. And you, by inviting me to play the dreaded 'Aunt Adelaide,' you simply helped me get back on track. And I am incredibly indebted to you for that.  You know, during the long course of my career in film and television and theater I have known and worked with the very best of their time. You know, Ingrid Bergman, that beautiful, lovely woman. Bette Davis, crazy, wonderful dame. Kate Hepburn, [makes a growling noise] you know...I give her credit, really, for getting me into the part...she really got me the part in 'State of the Union.' I don't think I ever would have got it without her help. And, you know, people like Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier and Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman and Spencer Tracy. James Earl Jones, who I just completed a six-month tour of 'Driving Miss Daisy' in Australia with; which was a fantastic experience. And I must tell you, I even had coffee in the MGM commissary with Clark Gable. That's as far as it went, you understand. But we were on the lot together. I once saw him driving down Sunset Blvd., I'll never forget, in a dark brown Mercedes convertible. I never got over it. And when I could afford it I got the same car in dark brown [laughs] and drove it for years until it was stolen.  But how would I have even begun my career in 'Gaslight' without the belief of the great directors of that time, in that case, of course, George Cukor. Or Arthur [sic] Lewin in 'The Picture of Dorian Gray.' Or been given the incredible role of 'Mrs. Iselin' in 'The Manchurian Candidate' by the great John Frankenheimer, whose widow is here with me tonight, bless her heart. And I'm so proud that she is. I just couldn't top that role, so I took off for Broadway and musical comedy by way of Stephen Sondheim's 'Anyone Can Whistle' and Jerry Herman's 'Mame.'  Now, movies have taken a bit of a back seat since then, except of course for darling 'Mrs. Potts' and 'Eglantine Price.' But in 1984, I came back to Universal City and I stayed around for twelve years playing 'Jessica Fletcher' in 'Murder, She Wrote.' The interesting thing is that 'Murder, She Wrote' has given me more worldwide attention than any role I ever played in movies or on the stage [laughs]. And it's a wonderful thing to be known, you know, in Spain and Portugal and Paris and France and Germany and everywhere, and, you know, to have a whole kind of worldwide career. That's what television does for you if have a hit show, and we did.  You know, you can't imagine how happy and proud, indeed I feel really undeserving of this gorgeous golden chap. And I want to thank the Governors' Honorary Oscar from the Academy tonight, and to be here in the company of my beloved family and friends instead of sitting, shivering with hope and then disappointment in Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the 1940s and 60s – yeah. Sharing this wonderful occasion with me tonight are my twin brothers Edgar and Bruce Lansbury, who traveled with me and our mother Moyna to this great country as evacuees from England in 1940. And my sons Anthony and David, and my darling daughter Deirdre, and my wonderful grandchildren Peter, Katherine and Ian. Let me tell ya, it doesn't get much better than that. Thank you."

Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a longtime dream of mine that I would one day receive an Honorary Oscar, and tonight I feel I am one step closer to that dream. [Tom Hanks walks over to the podium to take a picture of himself with Martin.] Oh, cool. Hey! Thanks [laughs]. So now it's just, the class level has dropped completely. I can't possibly express how excited I am tonight, because the Botox is fresh. You know, it is said that the art and craft of filmmaking is collaborative, so to be singled out and rewarded tonight means that that is not true. [Looking around the room:] Is it my imagination or is this year's Oscar ceremony a little on the cheap side?  I must thank the people who spoke on my behalf tonight. My high school friend Bill Taylor. Bill – by the way, he was a distinguished visual effects artist and cinematographer – whoever thought we would meet more than fifty years later on such an auspicious stage. Congratulations on your life and career too, Bill. And following Bill, a comedian so renowned and funny, whose work has only grown over the years and who never fails to make us laugh in new and unique ways; if only we had had someone like that tonight. You should have seen Marty Short's face fall when I told him the gift basket was taxable. And then the beautiful speech by Tom Hanks. Thank you, Tom. Everybody loves Tom Hanks. What a talent. Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks...I saw 'Captain Phillips.' I didn't think it was so funny.  But seriously, I have so many people in my career to mention and thank. My very first manager back in the sixties, Bill McEuen. My first two agents, Marty Klein and John Gaines; some of you may remember them. John Gaines was all business. One time he called me and he said, 'Steve, two things. One: hello...' Carl Reiner. How lucky was I to get with Carl Reiner, who taught me so much about how to work on a script. David Picker. Michael Gendler, my lawyer for over, I think it's thirty years is it, Michael? Something like that. I stick with people until they die. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. Nora Ephron. Frank Griffin, my makeup man for over – how many? Twenty years? More than that, more than that. Dan Melnick, a producer who had a great eye for a script. Fred Schepisi, who directed 'Roxanne.' John Hughes, who wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles.' I read the first script and it was, the first script was 165 pages long. I loved the script. I said to John, 'What are you thinking about cutting?' And he said, 'Cutting?' The first cut of the film was 4½ hours long.  Phil Robinson, who's here tonight, and wrote 'All of Me,' which absolutely changed my career. Brian Grazer, another producer who kept his eye on the script. Ron Howard. David Mamet. Larry Kasdan, the great Larry Kasdan. Frank Oz, who's here tonight, who did so much great comedies, some of my best comedies with him. Mick Jackson, who directed 'L.A. Story.' John Landis, who directed the little movie that could, the '¡Three Amigos!.' Bob Simonds. Ed Limato, God rest his soul. Adam Venit. So many of my agents have died; watch out, Adam. My wife Anne Stringfield, who is as beautiful as she is smart. And...hey [begins to tear up]. I knew I wasn't going to make it through this speech. I read it to my dog this morning and wept. My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life but now she has brought me a wonderful child. And for some mysterious reason she really loves that child. I don't know; I don't get it.  In 2008, Nancy Meyers asked me to appear in 'It's Complicated' with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. And I hadn't done a movie in a long while and I didn't really know how I felt about them anymore. Because along with the joy that they had brought me over the past thirty-four years, people in this room know they also bring an equal amount of artistic heartache. And I went out to the set, across the Queensboro Bridge, on that cold winter morning. And on the first day of shooting I opened the door to the dark soundstage, and I stepped over all those black snaking electric cables, and walked past the craft service table that overflowed with boxes of raisins and bagels and muffins, and the slowest toaster in the world, and jars of M&M's and Twizzlers for breakfast, and every variety of mustard. And as I made this little journey that I had made a thousand times at every studio in this city, walking through the corridors, through this flimsy plywood flats, and the light changing from pitch black to blinding white, I thought: Home. So to get an award for something that you realize has seeped into your bones and to understand tonight that the work over the decades has at least meant something to someone is especially satisfying.  But working in the movies has also brought something, an amazing gift, that has accummulated through these decades of filmmaking that cannot be matched, something wonderful and magical and its impact on my life is profound. Friends – fascinating, funny, and lifelong. Many of them are here in this room tonight. So thank you, movies, and thank you, Academy, for this award and a glorious reminder of the true benefit that I have received."

Piero is passionate about his work and therefore it is with great excitement that he received the news of this unexpected Honorary Award. An award for which he thank all of the Academy and which he accepts also thanks that through this recognition the Academy intended to bestow recognition to all those who work with behind the camera. Piero wishes to thank Deborah Landis for the dedication with which she change our work.  Though Piero is not here, at his table are many colleagues and fellow companions with which he feels to share this recognition: Ann Roth; Milena Canonero; Gabriella Pescucci; Dino Trappetti, CEO of Tirelli Costume House; and Carlo Poggioli. But Piero asked me, an actress, to collect this prize because he believes that the work of a costume designer is mainly dedicated to us, the actors. I suspect that he choose me because he think he made me suffer a lot during the ten films we did together, even if he said something different. 'Dear Claudia, please go to pick up my prize. With you there will be 'Angelica' and 'Bianca,' 'The Leopard' and 'La viaccia,' Visconti and Bolognini, and all the Italian cinema to which I have devoted my entire career.' On behalf of Piero, thank you very much."

All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.  There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, 'When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.'  To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.  And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, 'Who's your hero?' And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, 'Who's your hero?' I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, 'So, are you a hero?' And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, 'Why?' I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.  So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you."

To the Academy, thank you.  In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl who was pregnant with her second child. She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother, and she's here tonight. And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream. To my brother, Shannon, the best big brother in the world, you're a true artist. Thank you so much for sharing this insane and amazing adventure that is Thirty Seconds to Mars, and for being my best friend. I love you. Thank you.  To all the dreamers out there around the world watching this tonight in places like the Ukraine and Venezuela, I want to say, we are here. And as you struggle to, to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible, we're thinking of you tonight. And this is incredibly special as well, because there's so many people that helped me get here. And I just want to say thank you to Focus Features, to Mick Sullivan, to Jim Toth, to Jason Weinberg, to Emma Ludbrook, to Callie Addams, to the entire 'Dallas Buyers Club' team. Matthew, I love you. Jean-Marc.  And this is for the 36 million people who have lost the battle to AIDS.

Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in 'American Hustle' blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.  And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that 'Blue Jasmine' stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!  Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of 'Blue Jasmine,' I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in 'Blue Jasmine,' I thank you so much.  And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on 'Blue Jasmine,' it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you."

And I'd like to thank Chris Rock for bringing humor into the moment. And I'd like to also thank all of you who are here this evening. My very good friends and very close friends, who have turned out to be in support. And all the rest of you whom I don't know intimately but have felt your presence in my life because I've seen your art, I've seen your work, I've seen your poetry and I have been inspired by much. So thank you for all this, and I will now get on with my remarks for this evening.  America has come a long way since Hollywood in 1915 gave the world the film 'Birth of a Nation.' By all measure, this cinematic work was considered the greatest film ever made. The power of moving pictures to impact on human behavior was never more powerfully evidenced than when after the release of this film American citizens went on a murderous rampage. Races were set one against the other. Fire and violence erupted. Baseball bats and billy clubs bashed heads. Blood flowed in streets of our cities and lives were lost. The film also gained the distinction of being the first film ever screened at the White House. The then-presiding president, Woodrow Wilson, openly praised the film. And with the power of this presidential anointing validated the film's brutality and its grossly distorted view of history. This, too, further inflamed the nation's racial divide.  In 1935, at the age of eight, sitting in a Harlem theater, I watched in awe and wonder the incredible feats of the white superhero, Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan was a sight to see. This porcelain Adonis, this white liberator, who could speak no language, swinging from tree to tree, saving Africa from the tragedy of destruction by a black indigenous population of inept, ignorant, void-of-any-skills population governed by ancient superstitions with no heart for Christian charity. Through this film the virus of racial inferiority, of never wanting to be identified with anything African, swept into the psyche of its youthful observers. And for the years that followed Hollywood brought abundant opportunity for black children in their Harlem theaters to cheer Tarzan and boo Africans. Native Americans, our Indian brothers and sisters, fared no better. And at the moment, Arabs ain't lookin' so good.  But these encounters set other things in motion. It was an early stimulus to the beginning of my rebellion. Rebellion against injustice and human distortion and hate. How fortunate for me that the performing arts became the catalyst that fueled my desire for social change. In its pursuit I came upon fellow artists, like the great actor – and my hero – singer-humanist Paul Robeson, painter Charles White, dancer Katherine Dunham. Historian's superior academic mind, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois. Social strategist and educator Eleanor Roosevelt. Writers Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou and James Baldwin. They all inspired me. They excited me. Deeply influenced me. And they were also my moral compass. It was Robeson who said, as you heard in the film earlier, 'Artists are the gatekeepers of truth. They are civilization's radical voice.' This Robeson-environment sounded like a desired place to be and given the opportunity to dwell there has never disappointed me.  For my life of activism and a commitment to social change, the opposition has been fiercely punitive. Some who have controlled institutions of culture and commentary have at times used their power to not only distort truth but to punish the truthseekers. With interventions like McCarthyism and the blacklist, Hollywood, too, has sadly played its part in these tragic scenarios and on occasion I have been one of its targets. However, from the cultural environment that gave us all this social drama, all those movies – 'Birth of a Nation,' Tarzan of the Apes, 'Song of the South,' to name but a few – today's cultural harvest yields a sweeter fruit. 'Defiant Ones,' 'Schindler's List,' 'Brokeback Mountain,' '12 Years a Slave,' and many more. And all of this happening at the dawning of technological creations that will give artists boundless regions of possibilities to give us deeper insights into human existence. How fortunate for me that I have lived long enough for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to have chosen to bestow this honor upon me.  Tonight is no casual encounter for me. Along with the trophy of honor, there's another layer that gives this journey this kind of wonderful Hollywood ending. To be rewarded by my peers for my work in human rights, and civil rights, and for peace, well, let me put it this way. It powerfully mutes the enemy's thunder. Approaching eighty-eight years of age, how truly poetic that as I joyfully glow with my fellow honorees we should have in our midst as one of our celebrators a man who did so much in his own life to redirect the ship of racial hatred in American culture. His efforts made the journey a bit easier. Ladies and gentlemen, I refer to my friend – my elderly friend – Sidney Poitier. [Poitier joins him onstage.]  I thank the Academy and its Board of Governors for this honor, for this recognition. I really wish I could be around for the rest of this century to see what Hollywood does with the rest of the century. Maybe, just maybe, it could be civilization's game changer. After all, Paul Robeson said, 'Artists are the radical voice of civilization.' Each and every one of you in this room with your gifts, and your power, and your skills, could perhaps change the way in which our global humanity mistrusts itself. Perhaps we as artists and as visionaries for what's better in the human heart and the human soul, could you influence citizens everywhere in the world to see the better side of who and what we are as a species.  I thank each and every one of you for this honor. And to my fellow honorees, I could have had no better company than to have shared this evening with each of you. Thank you very much."

And then, of course I'm very grateful to the members of the Academy for accepting me as a new member and this totally unexpected Oscar.  I think at the moment here tonight about some of the great directors I've been working with and who have already passed away. Like Luis Buñuel, of course, Jacques Tati, Louis Malle, Patrice Chéreau, Nagisa Ôshima, Marco Ferreri, Jacques Deray. They all taught me something, each of them. And they're always present, even today, even now in this moment, when I'm working and when I hear, I believe I hear their voices in my ears. In a way, they are all here tonight with us. And of course I think also about the directors who are still alive, like that one [pointing to Philip Kaufman onstage], and like Volker Schlöndorff that you saw in the film. Like Milos Forman, of course. Like Peter Brook, who is going to turn ninety pretty soon and still very much alive and working. So that's all I want to say. We – a screenwriter is nothing without a director. And with such directors as the ones I've been happy to work with, it's a gift. It's just a series of gifts.  Now I'd like also to say something about the fact that this Oscar goes to a screenwriter. And I'm very happy of this because very often the screenwriters are forgotten, are ignored. They are like shadows passing through [the] history of cinema. Their names do not appear in the reviews, very seldom, but still they are filmmakers. That's why tonight I like to share this priceless statue with all my colleagues – the ones I know, the ones I don't know – from all over the world to share with them. So we all thank you."

If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.  I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this."

Honestly, this is crazy in a way, talking about that little prick called ego. Ego loves competition, right? Because for someone to win, someone has to lose. But the paradox is that, you know, true art, true individual expression, as all the work of these incredible fellow filmmakers, can't be compared, can't be labeled, can't be defeat because they exist and our work only will be judged, as always, by time. So, I am, you know, I [am] very thankful, grateful, humbly honored by the Academy which I thank for this incredible recognition. Which I have it here [the Oscar] because the work of all the actors, all the producers. Chivo Lubezki – which I didn't mention – Chivo, I love you. You are the genius.

This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South Side of Chicago dreaming of a better life, to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression, to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy. This bridge was built on hope, welded with compassion and elevated by love for all human beings.  JOHN STEPHENS (John Legend): Thank you. Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were fifty years ago, but we say that Selma is now because the struggle for justice is right now. We know that the Voting Rights Act that they fought for fifty years ago is being compromised right now in this country today. We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. When people are marching with our song, we want to tell you we are with you, we see you, we love you, and march on. God bless you.  LONNIE LYNN (Common): Thank you, Ava. Thank you, Ava.

So, in this brief time here, what I want to use it to do is to say this: When I was sixteen years old I tried to kill myself, because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong. And now I'm standing here. And so I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or she doesn't fit in anywhere. Yes, you do. I promise you do. You do. Stay weird. Stay different. And then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage, please pass the same message to the next person who comes along.

So I'm here to thank the Academy and all of you in this room for this truly incredible honor. I can't tell you how excited she is about it.

They're up here snappin' on my Oscar edition Air Jordans [shows off his gold sneakers] given to me by the great Michael Jordan for this occasion. Don't hate! But what a honor. Look at this: Denzel; my Morehouse brother, Samuel Jackson; Wesley Snipes. Goddamn! Shit! [Lee applauds.]  All right, I gotta – you know, you guys, when you chose that song, 'A Change Is Gonna Come,' yeah, it's been a long time comin'. So I want to thank Cheryl Boone Isaacs [Lee applauds], the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, trying to bring some flava up in here. We need some flava up in here! I want to thank the Board of Governors. I'm very sorry Debbie Reynolds is not here tonight, would have loved to meet her in person. And Gena [Lee applauds], it's an honor.  And no one's done this, but I gotta give love to my table, because people come from a long way. Mr. Gene Freeman, my man, his son Dylan; my agent Toni Howard and her partner David Yarnell; one of Brooklyn's finest, Mr. John Turturro; my long-time producer John Kilik; the wonderful LaTanya Richardson Jackson. Where are you, LaTanya? My siblings: David Lee, Cinqué Lee, Joie. Now, David – I don't know if you're lookin' at the photographs earlier – he has been my unit photographer from film school, NYU. So all those great photographs of me, he took. I told him he needs to make a book. My sister Joie, in many of my films. My brother Cinqué, Cinqué Lee, who's the videographer. My sister-in-law Tracey Elligan. My two children who are now in film school [Lee applauds]. They go to my alma mater where I'm a tenured professor. Tenured! For 15 years I've been teaching film at New York University Graduate Film School, so. Thank you. My great, wonderful in-laws, George and Lillian [Lee applauds] Lewis. My father is not – he's not able to be here tonight. And then my lovely, strong, partner, wife, Tonya. Tonya, stand up [Lee applauds]. Stand up. Now, if you see my body of work, I call it B-T and A-T. So you see my body of work 'before Tonya' and 'after Tonya' dealing with women, you could tell where I got married. So thank you for that.  All right, I'm gonna take my time. As they say in church: Take your time.  SAMUEL L. JACKSON: You mean like black church? Um-hmm.  SPIKE LEE: A little bit. How'd I get here? Well, I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. And my late mother, who died when I was in film school, she was the one that – her name is Jacquelyn Shelton Lee – she was the one that introduced me to film. My father, a great jazz musician, he hated movies, so I was my mother's date and she would drag me to movies. And so my introduction to Martin Scorsese was when she took me to see 'Mean Streets.' Went away to college, [pointing to presenter Samuel L. Jackson] alma mater, Sam, Morehouse College. I'm a third generation Morehouse man. My grandfather went to Morehouse. My father went to Morehouse; he was a freshman when Martin Luther King was a senior. And my grandmother and my mother went to Spelman. These are two historic black schools across from each other, across the street from each other, in Atlanta, Georgia. Of course, Sam's wife is from Spelman.  When I went to college I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I had to go to college, I had to go to Morehouse. So my first two years I was... lost in the wilderness. I was a D-plus, C-minus student. It wasn't 'cause I wasn't smart, just not motivated. So at the end of my sophomore year my advisor said, before it's time to go back home for the summer, go back to New York, she said, 'You have to think long and hard about choosin' a major.' And I said, 'Why?' She said, 'Because you've exhausted all your electives.'  So I came back to New York. The infamous summer of 1977. And I thought, up to that point you could always get a job in New York if you had your working papers, but that summer in 1977 New York City was broke. There's a famous Daily News front page: 'Ford to City' – that's President Ford – 'Ford to City: Drop Dead.' There were no jobs. So I did not want to sit on my stoop and play Strat-O-Matic Baseball all summer – no one heard about Strat-, no one played Strat-O-Matic Baseball back here? Come on! [Lee applauds.] Somebody! Anyway. My team was the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers. So that summer... it was crazy. It's really crazy because that summer I ended up making a film about that summer, Summer of Sam, so you never know how this stuff works.  So one day I'm on my stoop – we call 'em stoops, not porches, in Brooklyn. And I'm gonna say let me go see my friend Vietta Davis. Now, she was very smart. New York City public high school is like this: Stuyverson, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech. And she was a genius. I mean, right then and there she knew she wanted to be a doctor, ended going to Princeton, then Harvard Med School. She's a doctor now in Chicago. Anyway, I'm gonna say let me see what she's doing. So I go to her house and I ring the bell, and she says come on up. And we're sittin' in the living room, and in the corner is a box. And I say, 'What's in the box?' She says, 'A Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor so you can have it.' Then I say, 'What's in the other box?' She says, 'That's film for a Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor, you can have it.'  So, now I have something to do for the summer. I was not gonna play Start-O-Matic Baseball on the stoop all summer. And so it was a great summer to shoot because a couple of days later there was a blackout. It's a blackout, and so my father drove me around – we had a Citroën, yellow Citroën station wagon. So when my fellow brothers and sisters and my fellow Puerto Rican brothers and sisters started to loot, I filmed it. I went up to 125th St., Harlem, filmed the looting. Went into Fulton St. in Brooklyn. Choice items were color TVs, washin' machines, Pampers and Walt Frazier Clyde Pumas. And so I filmed that. And then that summer, in summer 1977, was the first summer of disco. So every block, weekends, people hookin' up their turntable and speakers to the street lamps, I was filming that. And then there was a guy named David Berkowitz, Son of Sam. So he had most of New York terrified. See, this is before gentrification. So back in 1977, if Son of Sam were to come into Harlem, Bed-Stuy, they would have killed him. Before – way, way back before gentrification.  So I have all this footage and I go back to school and I say, I'm gonna be a mass communications major. And there's a teacher there, who's still teachin' there today, his name's Dr. Herb Eichelberger. He encouraged me to make a documentary out of this footage. The film was called 'Last Hustle in Brooklyn.' From then, my junior and senior years, I was a A-plus student. I was C– [applause] ...yeah. But the reason why – I didn't get any smarter; I just was interested. So, I don't say I found film, film found me.  Moving forward. I graduate. I know that story about working your way up from the mailroom doesn't work for black people, so I say I'm gonna try to go to film school. So I apply to USC and AFI, and I don't get in USC or AFI because I don't have the astronomical score on a GRE. But lucky for me they had more forward thinking people at NYU, who said whether you get into film school or not shouldn't be determined by a standardized test. So I got in to NYU and that's where I met Ernest Dickerson. Great, great DP. Ernest and I were the only two people in the program. And we bonded automatically 'cause I went to Howard – excuse me – I went to Morehouse and he went to Howard. And here's the thing I'd like to say. The reason Ernest and I were successful, because our parents told us from a very early age that we had to be ten times better than our white classmates. That just being the same was not gonna be enough. That was instilled for me from the beginning. That we as a people here, if you're just trying to [Lee makes mid-level hand gesture]... nuh-huh. You gotta be better. You have to extra excel. You have to excel. So...  DENZEL WASHINGTON: Nothing's changed.  SPIKE LEE: Come on, 'Nothing's changed.' That's D right there, the man!  So! Three years of film school. I do a film, my thesis film is called 'Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop' and it wins the Student Academy Award. I won the Student Academy Award back in 1983. So I had a agent. Man, I thought that Spielberg's gonna call me, Lucas, Fox, Universal. And I had a little apartment off Myrtle Ave. on Fort Greene, before gentrification. So I had my – now the Student Academy Award is not like this [pointing to the Oscar statuette]. It's a wooden box with a circle with this [the Oscar image] on it. So I know for sure, because I have a Student Academy Award, I'm gonna take over Hollywood. But a funny thing happens. When you don't pay Ma Bell, you don't pay Con Edison, and you don't pay Brooklyn Union Gas, the phone gets turned off, the heat gets turned off, and lights get turned off. So I was in the dark just by havin' my Student Academy Award. And then I woke up. And so that's when I learned a tough lesson: Nothin' happens overnight. There's no such thing as a overnight success. And that's the biggest thing we do to our young people, to tell them that there's a thing, a animal, as a overnight success. You have to bust your ass, roll up your sleeves and attack, attack, attack, attack, every single day. And that's what I've been tellin' my film students at NYU for the last 15 years.  [Looking down at his notes:] Let me turn a page here.  DENZEL WASHINGTON: How many pages you got, Spike?  SPIKE LEE: Two more, D! [Laughs.] So, at this point...  WESLEY SNIPES: I told you about patience, didn't I? I told you about having a lot of patience when you're working with this guy.  SPIKE LEE: So, I'd like to say I'm very happy. You know, this is a great night. My family's here, and many friends, people I work with, but it's not been easy. And I'm just as proud – as this award – as a people, we got into this industry, behind and in front of the camera. That was always the goal. It's like, if I got in I was gonna try to bring as many mutherfuckers with me as possible. It'd be like Public Enemy, bum rush the show! 'Cause they're coming in here.  'Malcolm X.' We're gettin' ready to shoot 'Malcolm X,' and we're meetin' with the Teamsters. I say, 'Sir –' Tommy O'Donnell. I say, 'Sir, do you have any black Teamsters?' He says, 'No.' I said, 'That's a problem.' I said, 'Until you get some black Teamsters, we're gonna have the Fruit of Islam drive trucks. And if you wanna come to the set and fuck with the Fruit of Islam, come on.' Next day five black Teamsters showed up. But some people don't do that. But I don't care about that, I knew I had to make changes like that or we wouldn't be where we are today.  In closing... [Lee looks at audience and applauds.] In closing – I always say this, but if it's been redundant then please forgive me. I wanna thank my grandmother – Sam, you met my grandmother – Zimmie Shelton Lee. Her grandmother was a slave, yet she graduated with a college degree. And for 50 years she taught art. Van Gogh was her favorite painter. For 50 years she taught art in the state of Georgia. And for 50 years she never had one white student because of Jim Crow laws in that state, and for 50 years white students missed on a great art teacher. And for 50 years my grandmother saved her social security checks for her grandchildren's education. And since I was the first born, I had first dibs. So my grandmother, through 50 years of saving her social security checks, put me through Morehouse, put me through NYU Film School, gave me the money for my thesis film, and then gave me the money for 'She's Gotta Have It.'  And I wanna commend the President, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, because she is tryin' to do somethin' needs to be done. I don't know if you know this but the United States Census Bureau says that by the year 2043, white Americans are gonna be a minority in this country. And for all the people out there who are in position of hiring, you better get smart because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like. And I'm gonna get real here. Everybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I ain't see no black folks except brother man at the security guard, who checks my name off the list as I go into the studio. So we could talk, you know, yabba-yabba-yabba, but we need to have some serious discussion about diversity and get some flava up in this. This industry is so behind sports it's ridiculous. It's easier to be the President of the United States as a black person than be the head of studio. Honest! It's easier to be the President of the United States than to be head of a studio, or head of a network. Let's leave Oprah out of it. She doesn't count. So, President, keep it going. I know it's tough, we've got a long way to go. Peace and love to people in France. And my last thing [holding up the statuette]... is Brooklyn in the house?! [Shouts and cheers from audience.] Brooklyn's in the house. Thank you very much."

GENA ROWLANDS: So, good evening. I want to thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this wonderful evening. I feel truly honored to be here. And, you know what's wonderful about being an actress is you don't just live one life – yours – you live many lives. And for that we have to thank the writers. After all, they're the ones who start out with a piece of blank paper and they create the story. And then they create the characters in the story, and that gives us actors the opportunity to, hopefully, bring all of those characters to life. And that's another wonderful thing about being an actress. You get to work with a lot of people, often other actors, that you have long admired. I was especially lucky because I got to work with Bette Davis, my all-time favorite.  We did a picture called 'Strangers,' and I was thrilled to death when I heard that she was cast. And one day, we were finished with the day's work, and we went down to see the dailies, the film that we shot the day before. And we went to the screening room and they turned off the lights and they started the film. And I sat there like all actors do at the dailies, watching myself. Seeing if I did that too slowly, or if I didn't know, or it [wasn't] quite right, or if it was okay. And it did seem okay that day, so I was very happy.  And the lights went on and I started to gather my stuff to leave, and I looked over, and way in the far aisle was Bette and the cameraman. And they were too far away for me to hear what they were saying, but their body language was eloquent. Bette was... [Rowland points and gestures angrily]. And the cameraman was... [Rowlands smiles and makes placating gestures]. And since I was still, you know, I was so far away, I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I decided that this might be a good time for me to leave. And as I started for the door, Bette called out 'Gena!' She said, 'Would you wait just a moment, please? I need to talk to you.' And I said, 'Sure.' And she walked over to me, her eyes were still just blazing. And she said, 'Did you see my lips?'  I thought she was kidding. So I said, 'No, did you lose them?' And she said, 'That isn't funny. I mean my lips on the film that we just saw. They were bright orange! An unnatural orange! And [pointing] that's his fault, because he's the cameraman and he has the say-so about what colors are on the screen. So I think we ought to get rid of him, don't you?' And I said, 'Well, Bette, to tell you the truth I wasn't paying strict attention, I wasn't noticing the details, you know, of the colors at all, and I just let my mind wander, I guess.' And she said, 'Oh really? You weren't concentrating? You let your mind wander? Well, let me tell you something. You better start concentrating and paying attention to detail because I'm telling you, you're no spring chicken yourself.' But she was so funny; we had a great time.  Well, I don't want to talk your heads off, but I would feel remiss if I didn't mention my late husband John Cassavetes. He wrote me the most magnificent parts – and for other actresses, too – and sometimes he directed them, and I surely do have to thank him for that. Oh, and I did want to thank the Board of Governors for introducing me to this fine fellow [puts her hand on the statuette]. Tall and shiny and gold; very handsome. You know, he's just so elegant that I'll – that is if nobody objects – I think I'll take him home with me tonight. And I'll find... [looks for her son Nick, who holds up the statuette to applause].  NICK CASSAVETES: Blow 'em a kiss, Mom.  GENA ROWLANDS: [Rowlands throws a kiss to the audience.] And I'll find a wonderful place for him to sit. Maybe on the piano. And then everyone who comes to my house will have a chance to see him and admire him and love him the way I do. So thanks, Governors, and I'm very happy to see all of you here tonight in the audience. I'm happy to have been able to spend some time with you. Thank you."

I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. 'The Revenant' was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.  And lastly, I just want to say this. Making 'The Revenant' was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much."

So for me to have the chance to work with, I think, one of the greatest storytellers of our time, Steven Spielberg, has just been such an honor. And unlike some of the leaders we're being presented with these days, he leads with such love that he's surrounded by masters in every craft on this film. Every craft. Not the least, Mr. Tom Hanks. People... I'm so pleased that our film has been nominated so many times, and as a face of the film I meet many people in the streets. And it's lovely to have them, they're always saying to me, 'would it help?' and all that stuff. And I think if you ever wondered about acting with Tom Hanks, would it help? The answer's clearly yes.  I want to just say thank you to my fellow nominees. I don't know how they separate my acting from your glorious acting in these wonderful films that you're in, which everyone must see. I don't know how they separated the five of us from all the other supporting actors who are making films at the moment. It's a wonderful time to be an actor and I'm proud to be part of it.

Many years later I come to Hollywood, meeting with some big studio, director, my friend's house, Stallone's house. That was 23 years ago. I see these little things in his house. I touched it. I kissed it. I smelled it. I believe still have my fingerprints in; you keep it. Then I talk to myself, 'I really want one.' Finally, Cheryl calls. I said, 'Are you sure?' After 56 years [in the] film industry, making more than 200 films, I break so many bones. Finally, this is mine. This is mine.  I want to thank you, Hong King, incredible city, my hometown, my hood, who make me. China, my country. Proud to be Chinese. Thank you, Hollywood, for all those years teaching me so many things, and also make me a little bit famous. And I thank you, my family, my wife Joan, my son Jaycee, my special Jackie Chan Stunt Team.

There was a reason I stayed behind the camera. Seriously though, I feel so lucky to have had this wonderful life doing a job I love, working with some of the finest directors of the last 50 years on some of the most fascinating scripts ever written. And to top it off, travel around the globe to some of the planet's most incredible and mesmerizing locations. And can you imagine a job where you are actually paid to look into the eyes of George Clooney, Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Sean Connery, Albert Finney, Clint Eastwood, Richard Gere, Daniel Craig, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and those of '50 Shades of Grey' himself, Jamie Dornan?  My life has been so varied that I always say, I work with directors ranging from David Lean to David Lynch, Sir Carroll Reed to Steven Soderbergh, and Sidney Lumet to Wolfgang Peterson, and many other talented ones in between. Too many to mention; too many to upset that I didn't mention them, because you know how directors are. But I would like to thank them all for the good times, the manic and creative times, and even those times they keep me in the cutting room until the wee hours seven days a week. I might mumble something incoherent at the time, but looking back I wouldn't change a thing.  But of all those, I still have to say my greatest production are my three wonderful and talented children, without whose love and support I would not be up here today. My two sons, Anthony and James Hickox, are both writer/directors. My eldest, Anthony, has made over 30 feature films, and my youngest, James, isn't far behind him, having just spent six weeks in Greece shooting – lucky him. And of course, in the middle of these two is my daughter Emma, who swore she would never follow in my footsteps but somehow ended up a fabulous editor and is now taking my jobs. Between them they have gifted me four grandchildren. The eldest, my lovely Olivia. And then the gorgeous – Emma's two gorgeous, Mathilda and Alexander. And the newest arrival, Florence. I like to call them my own little dynasty.  So thank you once more for this very special award. I have to say I never suspected I would be holding one of these in my hand again. I like to think that I can share this with all the editors, the unsung heroes out there, most of them probably still working frantically as I speak, as this type of special award reminds us that we do not do so entirely unnoticed. Good night, and may whichever God you believe in bless you."

And so many individuals contributed to my fulfilling career. Robert Wise was responsible for my start in motion pictures, which then gave me an opportunity to collaborate with many of the most gifted directors in film history. They were always open to a new talent they'd never encountered. And incidentally, 'opened' is one of my favorite words. Because as I've said many times, you never know where or when you will find the answer. And I've found the answer in some very strange places. My search for the ideal choice led me to nearly every state in the United States, all around America. And in 1961 John Sturges sent me to Europe to cast 'The Great Escape,' and that allowed me to explore actors in so many remarkable locations and bring an authenticity – Germans playing Germans, Brits, and the rest of the cast. It was just an amazing experience. And my career has never been boring or lacking in surprises.  Norman Jewison, who's here tonight – I love so many people and he's certainly high on that list. We had a lot of fun together. It was really – you know and not just serious work, but joy. But there must be some major attention to detail. To never compromise is the key, no matter what the size of the role. Even if it's a reaction to something another actor is bringing. And it allowed me to reach out a helping hand and find opportunities for actors and actresses from the theater just embarking on their careers. Sometimes just a line or two, and sometimes with a role that became a stepping stone to great acclaim. Boy, does that warm the heart. And I treasure the ongoing relationships I've had with so many actors: Jeff Bridges, Bruce Dern, Andy Garcia, Martin Landau, John Travolta and Christopher Reeve, who I loved as a human being as well as his talent. So many gifted individuals have touched my life.  And I want to express my special appreciation to my associates and my assistants through the years. It would have been impossible for me to be able to concentrate and give a hundred percent to each director without their tireless contribution. Casting is alive and well in the new millennium. I so admire the achievements of today's casting directors and I'm so impressed with their creative contributions. And of course, the frosting on the cake tonight is having my loving family here with me. My son and daughter, my grandchildren, Nicholas and Kaylabella*, and my dear friends, to share this incredible honor and momentous occasion. I love you. Thank you."

It's a great and wonderful recognition of the work I've been doing for 50 years. What's kept me going is that it's fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. While making the movies is physically and intellectually demanding it's rare that I felt any strain. I'm lucky I found work that I like and that I continue to be obsessed with. This compulsion has always been understood by my wife, Zipporah, and my sons, David and Eric. I am grateful and very appreciative for their constant support. They recognized long ago that I'm a New England Jewish Puritan and let me go my errant ways. I'm also very pleased that my grandchildren, Tess and Ben and Charlie, are here tonight to help me celebrate.  I want to thank Karen Konicek, who has run my production company, Zipporah Films, for 35 years, and whose unfailing good cheer and sound advice has made it possible to wander around and make movies. I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to John Davey, the terrific cameraman with whom I worked since 1979. I'm glad that both John and Karen are here tonight. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the late William Brayne, the cameraman who worked with me on many earlier films. And also I want to thank the many others who helped in the production of the movies. Irwin Young, the President of DuArt Films, one of independent filmmaker's best friends, provided deferment deals which made many of my early films possible. I'm grateful to PBS for its support for all of my films. The films couldn't have made without – couldn't have not have been made without the constant support of The Ford Foundation and frequent grants from the MacArthur, Pershing Square, and LEF Foundations, ITVS and the Sundance Documentary Fund. Additional funding has sometimes been provided by my singing and selling pencils outside Neiman Marcus department stores.  Making a movie is always an adventure. I usually know nothing about the subject before I start, and I know there are those that feel I know nothing about it when it's finished. I never start with a point of view about the subject or a thesis that I want to prove. I also don't do any research in advance of the shooting. I usually don't know in advance what's going to be shot or what I'm gonna stumble across in any day or any moment of any day. The editing is an effort to impose order on the chaos of the rushes through the creation of a fictional form that provides meaning to the film. The goal is to make a film that is close to a, closer to a visual novel than a journalistic account. This process involves sitting in the editing room for eight to ten months, getting fed intravenously until the film is found.  Each film is also an opportunity to learn something about a new subject. I've been involved in a 50-year course in adult education, where I'm the alleged adult who studies a new subject every year. The variety and complexity of the human behavior observed in making one of the films, and cumulatively all of the films, is staggering. And I think it is as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference. There are always a lot of laughs and I'm not the first to observe that so much of human behavior, my own and others, is when seen from a detached point of view, funny. For example, when I was working on the film that became 'Near Death,' a film about dying patients, there were several occasions when we shot in the hospital morgue. On the last day of shooting I went around thanking the various staff who had been helpful. Among them was a man responsible for the morgue. I caught up with him in the hospital cafeteria and thanked him for his help. We shook hands warmly and he said, 'See you soon.' Thank you, and see you soon."

And one thing that they consistently told me – Zelda Fichandler, Ron Van Lieu, Ken Washington – is that it wasn't about you. It's not about you. It's about these characters. You are a servant, you're in service to these stories and these characters, and I'm so blessed to have had an opportunity. It was about 'Juan.' It was about 'Chiron.' It was about 'Paula.' The cast and crew was just such a wonderful experience. Thank you, Barry Jenkins. Thank you, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Adele Romanski, who forced Barry to cast me. [Laughs.] No, but it's just such a wonderful experience and I have so many people to thank who've gotten me here. My manager Carolyn Govers, who I've been with for 10 years. Just thank you so much. And the rest of the cast who did wonderful work, any one of them could be up here right now holding this trophy. It's such a gift getting to work with you and be inspired by you and the performances that you all offered up. So thank you, the Academy. Really appreciate this. And lastly, I just want to thank my wife who was in her third trimester during awards season. We just had our daughter four days ago. So, I just want to thank her for being just such a soldier through this process, and help, and really carrying me through it all. So thank you. Really appreciate it. Peace and blessings."

The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.  And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, 'O captain, my captain,' Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.  And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games. Thank you for the imagination. And to my husband and my daughter, my heart, you and Genesis. You teach me every day how to live, how to love. I'm so glad that you are the foundation of my life.

My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions.

Thank you all. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to Lionsgate. Thank you to our incredible cast and crew who are all up here right now. Thank you to Jamie Feldman, to Gary Gilbert. Thank you to my parents for supporting my choice to pursue a career in the arts even though it was a little bit crazy. Arthur Horowitz, you are my fantasy baby. And to my kind, generous, talented, beautiful, blue-eyed wife and creative partner, Julia Hart, you have inspired me to become the man I am right now, and more importantly the man I'm still becoming. There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work, work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope, and towards empathy.  MARC PLATT (Best Picture nominee, 'La La Land'): [1:32] Here's to the fools who made me dream: my uncle Gary Platt; my mentor Sam Cohn; my parents; my children; my wife, Julie, on whose shoulders I've stood for 40 years, because she insisted I reach for the stars. And to the Hollywood community that I'm so proud to be a part of, and to the Hollywood in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, [behind Platt, a production crew member is showing the other two producers the correct winner card] repression is the enemy of civilization. So keep dreaming, because the dreams we dream today will provide the love, the compassion and the humanity that will narrate the stories of our lives tomorrow. Fred?  FRED BERGER (Best Picture nominee, 'La La Land'): [Shakes his head 'no,' then steps up to the microphone.] [2:07] To the love of my life, Ali Loewy, I'm up here because of you. I love you so much. To my family, mama, papa, Jeff [unintelligible]. Matt Plouffe, you kicked this off. And Damien Chazelle, we're standing on your shoulders. [Turns around to look at the chaos behind him, then turns back as Warren Beatty begins to approach the microphone.] We lost, by the way. But, you know. There's a mistake.  JORDAN HOROWITZ: [2:22] [Walking to the microphone; Beatty tries to wave him off so he can speak.] You know what? Guys, guys, I'm sorry, no. There's a mistake. 'Moonlight,' you guys won Best Picture.  MARC PLATT: [off mic:] 'Moonlight' won.  JORDAN HOROWITZ: [off mic, walking toward the cast and crew of 'Moonlight' sitting in the front of the audience:] This is not a joke. Come up here [waves his hand for them to come up].  MARC PLATT: [at the microphone:] This is not a joke. I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.  JORDAN HOROWITZ: [back at the microphone:] This is not a joke. 'Moonlight' has won Best Picture. [Beatty pulls the winner card out of the correct envelope, which he now has in hand: Horowitz takes the card and holds it up for the camera.] 'Moonlight,' Best Picture.  JIMMY KIMMEL (ceremony host): [off mic:] I think you guys should keep it anyway... Oh, it's Warren, I'm sorry. [at the microphone:] Guys, this is very unfortunate what happened. Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this. [To Horowitz:] I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway. Why can't we just give out a whole bunch of 'em?  JORDAN HOROWITZ: [holding the Oscar given to him] I'm gonna be really proud to hand this to my friends from 'Moonlight.'  JIMMY KIMMEL: That's nice of you. That's very nice.  WARREN BEATTY: [off mic to Kimmel:] May I say something?  JIMMY KIMMEL: [off mic:] Warren Beatty would like to speak.  WARREN BEATTY: [Audience is very noisy.] Hello... hello. I want…  JIMMY KIMMEL: Warren, what did you do?!  WARREN BEATTY: [laughs] I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said: Emma Stone, 'La La Land.' That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny [laughs].  JIMMY KIMMEL: Well, you were funny.  WARREN BEATTY: Thank you very much. [Holds up the winner card.] This is 'Moonlight,' the Best Picture.  [Cast and crew from 'Moonlight' have all made their way onto the stage by now; several people from 'La La Land' are still onstage off to the side, while others have left.]  ADELE ROMANSKI: [5:25] Thank you.  BARRY JENKINS: Very clearly, very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I'm done with it, 'cause this is true. Oh my goodness.  ADELE ROMANSKI: Thank you, thank you.  BARRY JENKINS: And I have to say – and it is true, it's not fake – we've been on the road with these guys for so long and that was so gracious and so generous of them. My love to 'La La Land.' My love to everybody. Man.  ADELE ROMANSKI: Thank you to the Acad—I don't know what to say. That was really... I'm not sure, I'm still not sure this is real. But thank you to the Academy. It is so humbling to be standing up here with hopefully still the 'La La' crew? No, okay, they're gone. But it's very humbling to be up here. And I think, I hope even more than that, that it's inspiring to people, little black boys and brown girls and other folks watching at home, who feel marginalized and who take some inspiration from seeing this beautiful group of artists, helmed by this amazing talent, my friend Barry Jenkins, standing up here on this stage accepting this top honor. Thank you.  BARRY JENKINS: There was a time when I thought this movie was impossible because I couldn't bring it to fruition, I couldn't bring myself to tell another story. And so everybody behind me on this stage said, no, that is not acceptable. So I just want to thank everybody up here behind me. Everybody out there in that room – because we didn't do this, you guys chose us. Thank you for the choice. I appreciate it. Much love.  JEREMY KLEINER: Good night. Thank you so much.  JIMMY KIMMEL: Well, I don't know what happened. I blame myself for this. Let's remember, it's just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is we got to see some extra speeches. We have some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did. Thank you for watching. I'm back to work tomorrow night on my regular show. I promise I'll never come back. Good night."

And a special thank you tonight to my mother, Skippy O'Connell, who 39 years ago got me a job in sound. And when I asked her, 'Ma, how can I ever thank you?' She looked at me and she said, 'You know, I'll tell you how you can thank me. You can work hard. You can work really hard, and then someday you go win yourself an Oscar and you can stand up there on that stage and you can thank me in front of the whole world.' Mom, I know you're looking down on me tonight. So thank you. Thank you all so much. I really appreciate this."

Literally unprecedented support from all of the Disney brass, including Sean Bailey, Dave Taritero, Sam Dickerman, Pete Toby and our producer, Brigham Taylor. And last but not least, these three gentleman geniuses behind me, who commandeered a thousand superb artists and contributed so greatly and made so many winning decisions that, you know, quite frankly they actually got tired of winning. Like that's a thing. So, I think I'm done. Well, thank you to all our artists. The next round of applause is for you; you deserve it as much as we do. Thank you so much."

And I have to thank two women in particular, my publicist Paula Woods and Heather Secrist at A24. Thank you for taking care of me.  You know, I tell my students that I teach sometimes: Be in love with the process, not the result. But I really wanted this result, because a bajillion people are watching. And all you people out there who feel like there's no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected – the Academy has your back. The ACLU has your back. We have your back. And for the next four years we will not leave you alone. We will not forget you.  TARELL ALVIN McCRANEY: Amen, brother. I just want to echo everything you just said and all those thanks. But I also want to say thank god for my mother, who proved to me through her struggles and the struggles that Naomie Harris portrayed for all of you, that we can really be here and be somebody. Two boys from Liberty City, up here on this stage representing 305. This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender-conforming who don't see themselves.

And Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges, and all the wonderful actors in the film. Amazon and Roadside and Sierra have done such a beautiful job. The movie's about people trying to take care of each other in the face of terrible adversity. I have been taken care of my whole life by wonderful people who I love and who've loved me. I wouldn't be holding this if not for Mara Buxbaum. I wouldn't be here at all if it wasn't for J. Smith-Cameron. Nellie Lonergan, could not love you more but I will try.

And a farewell to my father, who passed away this year, as well. Thank you very, very much."
